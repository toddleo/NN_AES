years, and costly materials like a generator, and brand new water pipes.	the second thing she wrote about were the problems in irrigation in education. food was scarce, and the education was

help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. “also, “the goals were suppose to be met by 2015; some other targets are set for 2025. we are halfway to 2015, and the world is capable of meeting these goals. but our first glimpse of sauri showed us that there was plenty of work to do.” after i read this i thought that maybe the millennium villages is not ready to take on such a big project. i thought maybe this is to much to handel and they will not get this project by there assumed due date. i thought this because in kenya more than 20,000 kids die from malaria. and that families in sauri lived on less than $1 dollar a day. and also, many people are sick and go to the hospital but they don’t get treated they just share a bed with other sick people. and the hospital doesn’t even have any running water or electricity! if that is so then how can they see if they want to treat people. and when the author was in the hospital she said it was hard to see, and it made her scared and sad. and if i were her i would be scared and sad at the same time too. but then i read this it was 2004. but then i read this “the people of sauri have made amazing progress in

important because it is to know how bad it is and to make the world a better place to live in. also to know that we can help places that need the help. like kenya now. 	my first reason is that if we were in trouble like they are i would want them to help  me when i need it. she wrote that some people could’nt even learn in their schools. i would want someone’s help if i had no way to learn what i need to know. i mean that’s not good for the world that some people live in a country and cant even get an education there. like she said we should’nt have to pay for school if our country is one of the poorest.	my second reason is the fact that we need to know about whats been going on in our world. this could have happened to any country we were just lucky not to be the one country. i know kenya is not the only country but we need to take action before it does happen to us. she also said that when she got there it was so astonishing (not her actual word) to see how poor it looked as soon as she got there. unpaved streets, kids without shoes, and torn clothes. that just comes to show you if one group of people can do it what about 1,000 groups of people. we have more than enough people to make the world a better place. they used to have a clinical officar running the hospital now they have a doctor. instead of people having no education now they have and overwhelming size in their classes. they used to have 20,000 die from malaria that is nearly cut in to half that is saving 10,000 lives or more a day. they now have water, and electricity at the hospital. now their are bed nets in every site in sauri. farmers used to only have enough for their family they enough that they can eat and still sell some. kids used to have no energy they now have school lunches. it is

little convince by the author, because first of all there is more than 80 villages out there, and the m.v.p (short for millennium villages project) can't just help everyone, because it is not the whole world doing it, and there is more villages that the people in m.v.p, but if people going easy on it and got more people to joing, then the m.v.p may have a chance.	the second reason is that the m.v.p amy not have that much money, saving one village take a whole ton of money, but 80 villages? but everything have a solution and that is donation, or if the founder of the m.v.p is rich then that is another way to deal with the poverty of the villages.	the last and third reason is that people might be lazy or some other villages have a much bigger problem and maybe it will take longer than a person's lietime to finish helping one village. but people can always be not lazy and help out, and maybe when a member of the m.v.p gets old and a new one comes in. for the last thing is that maybe

them a better economy and equality of life in their communities, and that villagers got technical advice and practical items like, school supplies, fertilizer and medicine, and even though it would take some time, the goals would still be met and would make sauri a better place. another reason is because malaria is an disease in africa that mosquitoes carry and to treat the desease, you can buy a bed net that would treat malaria for five years but it cost $5.00, and many people did not have that much money, so now, bed nets are allways used with no charge at all and the people can be treated for five years. the author also convinced me because the children could not go to school because it cost money, but now the teacher gets paid and it cost no money at all for the children. my personal

free of charge, for al of the most common diseases. 2.) water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. 3.) bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. 4.) no school fees, they serve lunches, addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as tools.see, now children and adults can live a healthy life. i just think the people who are doing the millenium

over the world families, villages, and people are living in poverty. if we all work really hard together things should change.	when the village in kenya improved so much in just 4 years it showed us that we can over come poverty. in 2004 sauri was very poor no medicin, water, fertilizer, or misquito nets. but in 2008 it had all that so in 2012 it would be better and 2016 even better so by the time its 2040 imagine how advanced and good the village will be.	if wealthy people in well functioning citys all give their time like the author did in the text, it would help alot or even if every family in one school, city, or state gave 1 dollar to help stop poverty it would be alot! it would do wonders for a small, poor, village like sauri.	there are great organizations like the millennium village project to help 3rd world countries like kenya. so it helps alot if they helped sauri advance in just 4 years and even more organizations did this by 2040 poverty would just be a fact in a history text book. 	so i do think it is posible to overcome poverty. if we all give back, help, and donate money the world can become a better place and poverty will just be something in the past. i

bite them they get a disease.  the disease stop’s you from eating and it make’s you de-hydrated and you get really sick.  but they came up with bed net’s since mosquitoes come at night they got an idea which is bed net’s they are treated with chemical’s that can last for five year’s.  20,000 kids die each day from malaria and bed net’s could save millions of live’s.  the farmer’s there could not have successful crop’s because they were dying they did not have any fertilizer to help them stay alive.  there scared that they won’t have any food for the family’s to survive.  but now they have provided fertilizer, seed’s and tool’s for the farmer’s.  the children in school didn’t have many supplie’s.  not many book’s paper or pencil’s even though the children were so eager to learn it was hard to.  also they didn’t have any lunch during the day, but now there are no school fee’s and they serve lunch there.  this is the last exsample: hospital’s don’t have to medicine to save or cure

it was dark, and noone could wash. 	after the millennium villages project was started, they set targets and goals for poverty to be gone, for good. they started making bed nets with chemicals that

she felt bad for them, but 4 years later, sauri became more advanced. with crops, school medical suplies and payment(still medical), and to get rid of a deisease called malaria (in africa, it’s mostly carried around by mosutoes, who appear at night or shady areas) by using nets. ex. 3: sauri didn’t have or get much water. therefore, they did’t grow much crops, they mostly died, one of the most important things, they had were not growing well. sauri mostly lacks money so they dont get much out of kenya, so yeah, it’s amazing how in just 4 years, they can improve from a poor village, to a

sauri was in porverty is because there was a malaria disease. and farming, water and school fees. another thing that makes me convinced is that, this crisis is fixed in 4 years, which is in 2008, the text also saids” the people in sauri have made amazing progress in just four years.” something else that also makes me convinced is that the people lived on $1 a day in 2004, and now every single sleeping site has a bed net which costed $5, so this is an idea that shows that sauri did improve and beat poverty. another fact for this passage is that in 2004, many students had to pay for the school he/she went to, and many of them didn’t have a medday meal which might of caused concentrating in classes hard. then in 2008, there were no school fees, they served lunches, and the attendence

money; because people didn’t have enough money, they couldn’t get the resources they needed.	another reason why it was harder is because not a lot of people know about sauri. there isn’t a lot of general knowledge out there about sauri or its people.	aside from working hard, this program sets goals. the people working to make sauri better work even harder so those goals can be achieved by the time set, usually 2015 and some are set by 2025.	by working hard and setting goals, the village’s general welfare improved greatly half way to their deadline. in 2008 the hospital has all kinds of

either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it. there was no doctor, only a clinical officer running the hospital. there was no running water or electricity”. (1) even though there are simple solutions for those who seek medical treatment, they cannot afford things such as be nets, which only cost $5. each household lived on less than $1 a day. people who live in sauri need money so they can afford simple things to help keep them healthy.	the farmers in sauri had a hard time tending to crops. hannah sach claims that,” their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation”. (2) year after year, farmers plant their crops hoping that the plant will flourish and grow, but the lack of water and fertilizer makes it hard for anything to grow. when the crops don’t produce enough, then farmers won’t have much to harvest and the family will go hungry.	most children of sauri did not go to school. why? the couldn’t afford it. in sauri, kids had to work around the house or on the farm. even the schools couldn’t afford many supplies such as paper and pencils.	so what is the solution to this problem in sauri? the millennium villages has helped provide medicine for hospitals, which was free for people. the hospital now has water and electricity. families have bed nets to keep mosquitoes from people who are asleep. the millennium villages project has helped

still does, i believe. 	some people say that we deffinately can’t beat poverty in 50 years. i dissagree with this because many people are trying to help. those people out number those in poverty, so

also helped the kids and their education. they made the schools have no school fees, which helps a lot because a lot of the families did’nt have money and now the kids can get their education. it has

about how long it would take to just defeat poverty in africa. i do think that it’s possible to “win the fight against poverty” with the help of the millenium villages project, just not in our lifetime. 	one thing that the people of sauri needed help with was their crops. in this report, hannah sach states that farmers didn’t have the money for fertilizer and irrigation systems. without these things, the farmers would never know how many edible crops would be produced from each harvest. therefore, they would be left worrying and wondering if they would have enough money to feed their families. 	unfortunately, the disease malaria wasn’t uncommon in this village. without misquito nets, many children would die from this disease. since the people of sauri didn’t have enough money to keep nice hospitals, there was almost no hope for the people who caught the disease.people in sauri were also not very well educated. they had schools, but most families either didn’t have enough money, or needed their children to help out at home. they were also very lacking in school supplies. the children tried to learn with the materials that they had, but it made it very hard to learn.	although these problems were solved by the mellenium villages project, thats just one of the many villages in poverty all over the world. even though sauri is a much better place, there’s

countries, many funds, and a lot more projects like millenium villages, but isn’t that what the united nations is for? to make the world a better more peaceful and cooperative place? i know we as humans can abolish poverty in my lifetime throughout all 7 continents. believe…because poverty will become a distant memory very shortly.",2121502Y3_100228463.docx,"the author did convince me that

donate items that people suffering in poverty can use. people can donate $.50 a day to help poverty, that’s $15 a month.but also there is another problem, health. many people in africa suffer a disease caused by mosquitos. everyday many die from this disease, especially kids.",11212_020021421.docx,"i think this is achievable, but it would need more time than 2025. fundraising takes a long time, and you would need to travel from village to village. there are hundreds of villages so you had to be totally into it. if you can save one village from poverty, other villages could be saved too, not just in africa. food, water, and medecine are essential in life so they should have it and this project will help them get it. the kids go hungry afterschool just because they want to learn. they can barely learn with the few books, papers, and untensils they have. if we ever switched places with them, we could barely stand one week, yet they go through this every single day. we should help them because we could be in their situation one day. i think this project could reach its goal and end poverty one day, but even if it can’t, we should try and help them any way we can.",11232_020021966.docx,"i believe that there are lots of people in kenya who are still living in poverty right now.  with all the poverty going around th epeople will have hard times supporting themselves.  in my opinion we’ll be able to help all the people in poverty to change their lives.the first reason i believe so that the people’s lives can be changed is that there are lots of donaters that are willing to help the poor.  right now my mom is helping a child have a better life.  she donates $25 a month to support the child.  if more people are willing to do this most of the people in kenya will have healthier lives.secondly, i believe that this goal is stil achievable because we have already achieved part of the goal.  in the article is said “dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa.”  this goal have already been done half way.  by 2015 we’ll be able to achieve this no matter what comes.  supporter of the millenium villages projects will help.lastly, the goal of helping the poor will end before i die.  by 2025 when the new goals have been achieved people will start surviving longer.  like the article said “the hunger crisis has been adressed with ferlillizers and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply.”  now that people are eating enough they’ll be full of energy and able to work with their new fertillizers and tools.  if they make extra food they’ll be able to sell them and make money.  soon enough people will be out of poverty.  now that school is free people will be achieving better jobs.  also with free medicine for the most common diease people wouldn’t have to worry about sickness so much anymore and set their own goals to leave their poverty life.overall, i believe that the goal of edning poverty will be achieved in my lifetime.  like h said “part sauri’s progress shows us all that winning poverty is achievable in our lifetime.”  with all the school time kids have, food people will are planting, and free medicine will help people leave their old life behind.  eventually, the people will climb out their life of doom an dlive a life of happiness.  the children will all have great clothes and everyone will have a good life just like us.",2106502Y2_000492899.docx,"how would you feel if you were someone living in  kenya. i will feel sad because they really don’t have

achive this. i am sure they will because i know they are helping people with there supplies and needs like water, fertilizer. schooll supplies and cloths because in the text they said that “little kids were wraped in cloth on there mothers back, or running in barefood with tattered cloths” which tells me that they are doing the best they can with providing them with clothing and shoes they need. i also know they can achive because they are talking about the people in poverty and what they need for example they need many things like shelter and food. i know they can do it because it sates that they are doing the most possible.” i think its verey nice what they are doing. i would love to help every body there if i could and i know she can do it.",21182_020016795.docx,"helleskov_020016795	yes, the author did convince me that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime”. back in 2004, the people in sauri were suffering so much; barely any education, hard to farm, no electricity, not a lot of health care, and many more. by 2008, people were not suffering as much. they had a better amount of health care, electricity, water, and education. bed nets were also used in all the sleeping area. these changes weren’t only for one village, they happened in over 80 villages across sub-saharan africa! at this rate, people living there should be having a fairly normal life, like we do here.",31151_020030565.docx,the author told us winning a fight against poverty is achievable only if you try hard to help the poor. because alot of people in kenya are poor in 2004 then it rose up in 2008. i support it because it rosed high up and it never came down and some people are even rich. it's because of the help of poverty in the pass so it could like rise up. and it is said that they are halfway through their goal which is in 2015 or 2025 which is halfway through there.,11022_020025674.docx,"yes, she convinced me that it is achievable. i think so, and i am pretty sure so because i read the whole article and to me they achieved alot from having to pay for cheap medicine to free of charge for medicine with the proof’s of: “the rooms were packed with patients who probably would not recieve treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients couldn’t afford to pay for it.” to “the yala sub district hospital has medicine free of charge.” i think that is a great and amazing deal for the poor, so even if your poor or rich/wealthy people that are sick can still get treatment. and i agree to the position where i said yes, by declaring another reason. from “their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer & irrigration.” to “water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity.” i think that it is very, so important to have water in a hospital because hospitals are like the best place to go when injured or need help. and lastly for bed nets. well, sleeping is very important because it is the hours we got to re-energize our body and just lay down & relax. “each net costs $5.00.” that fraze bumbed me out because $5.00 isn’t really expasive here in america, but in kenya people worked hard & they only get $1 a day, maybe even less. so i think that the next fraze helps people a-lot! “bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri.” now, i think it’s an accomplishment for the people that made it happen.",41301_020021762.docx,"i do believe that it is possible for us to win the fight against poverty right now. already in four year, it made a huge difference, imagine if we made it even more years. the live of people are changing greatly because of this project. many people had died before this.	before there were hospitals, however it was not in good shape. people would need to share beds, some treatments would not happen either because of money or the hospital couldn’t do it. there was no real docter, and no water or electricity. many people died because of malaria which was a disease spread by mosquitoes. there was a bed net that could prevent that, but not everyone could afford it.	now the hospital had medicine which cost no money. the medicine cured most common diseases. there was a generator for electricity, and water was connected to the hspital. there was now bed nets in every sleeping site. that is a huge difference compared to before. that already make me feel like we could win the fight.		before farmers had failed to grow many of their crops. it was either by no water or to little fertilizer. the farmers might have harvest enough food to feed their family. their kids might go hungry, and even become sick.	now a lot of it has been fixed. there is now enough fertilizer and seeds. not only that, but tools needed to maintain food supply. once again a big difference. from going to almost no food supply to enough of it.	finally, before people couldn’t afford to go to school. a lot of kids needed to stay home, and help with chores. even, if you could afford it, at school there were very few supplies. also kids would be hungry at the end of the day. lunch couldn’t be provided because of money.	now school was free to go to! there was also enough money now to get a lunch. so education would be up, and also the kids would accually have energy.	many of these examples show great improvement. so i believe it is possible to win the fight agains proverty.",4123501Y2_000510069.docx,"i think the answer is yes, we can win the fight

that would be easier than one group to a village.	another way i know we can win the fight against poverty is because if they give the farmers fertilizer and seeds they can make monye and they can take care of their own families.	the last reason is if the hospital gets some real doctoras the pationtes will get batter and they will go work and get out of poverty. theas examples prove that we

were too tired because the schoold doesn't supply lunches.	in 2008 the schools have been supplied with materials and now provided with lunch. with that help the students are learning.	after

no longer have fees that you have to pay, medicine for free, water is not connected to hospital and so is electricity, there is no poverty, and schools now serve lunch in them. this has happened at 80

medicine, electricity, and fertilizer and seeds were all used to fight poverty in sauri. medicine is one of the biggest weapons against poverty, because with medicine less people will die. this means that more people could help farm and people won’t be as sad. medicine also helps stops kids from starving from diseases. electricity is also another important weapon in the fight against poverty. with electricity kids can use the extra light to study and hospital can use it to help patients with more serious diseases. electricity can also give people things to relax with like a tv. fertilizers and seeds are probably the most important vol in fighting poverty. fertilizer and seeds help plants grow which can be eaten by the people or by livestock. if extra plants are grown families can also sell them for money or give them to schools. food can also make people feel better and it can also prevent death from star vapor. with the extra money from selling the food, more families will be able to send their kids to school. in conclusion, i believe that we can, “win the fight against poverty” with medicine, electricity, and fertilizers and seeds.",4109591Y2_000491114.docx,"i think the goal of

is carried by mosquitos and infect people by biting them.  kids can die from this disease and adults get very sick.  a bed net that is treated with chemicals, keeps away mosquitos that carry malaria, it can last up to 5 years!  and also in sauri, kenya crops didn’t grow good because they need fertilizer and water.  and alot of people get worried.  and in schools, not all children go to schools because their parents can not afford the school fees.  and schools didn’t have lunch and the kids when they were done at school, they were tiried and didn’t have any energy.  but then in 2008, all of

to the sides they said it will be done in 2025. and nobody knows what could happen between now and then. 	plus, they don’t have many resources. and they are in extreme poverty. they don’t have much education, due to poverty. and they need to have proper knowledge to make houses and things. 	and if they lack of water, it will be hard for them to stay hydrated. so we have to help them believe

the better. she gave specific examples about the aspects of the african people’s lives, both before and after the project, persuading me to believe that it’s possible to win the fight against poverty. in the next few paragraphs, i will be telling you my reasons for believing.	first off, the example sachs gave about the hospital in the yala sub-district improved rapidly in four years. before it was helped by the millenium village project, it had “no doctor…no running water or electricity. patients in the hospital rarely received treatment because they were either poor or the hospital had no supplies. that was before. but now, after the milennium village project, the hospital now had medical supplies that are free of charge, water, and electricity.	next, is the farming. because the african people had no essential farming tools, their crops didn’t grow well. after the project assisted them by giving them supplies; however, there are less hungry mouths to feed.	lastly, there are the schools. back then, most kids didn’t go to school because they couldn’t afford it. even when they were allowed to go to school, supplies were low and there were no meals produced for the students.

posiable in my life time. the only way that we can win the fight is by inproving the living condisions of the people that live in the poor places. we also need to help out in these places as much as posiable. we need to give them clothing, houseing, clean water, electricity, and a better hositals or health clinic. we need to give them medicine to help the sick people.	we can give them better living condisions by making the floors not by dirt but sement. a home that has a roof, windows, doors, light, and clean working water. they would also need wormth, blankets, moskito nets, and cratens.

scales, files, and vacsense. they need a new building not a run down one. the floors need to not be dirt. they also need people that know how to use them.	we can give them a better education by having teacher, class room, students, and a building that is proper. they need books that teach them, teachers that incerage them to have a better future. also have all the elementary, high school,

in our lifetime. i believe this because it took such a short time for sauri to make great progress, the project had already had great progress on many other villages, and the amount of supporters is getting larger.	one reason why i believe we can win the fight against poverty is because it only took 4 years for sauri to have amazing progress. the yala sub-district hospital has medicine for most common diseases, it now has water and electricity, there are bed nets in every sleeping site and more. 4 years is considered a very short time to make such amazing progress for a village that was so messed up.	another reason is that the millennium villages project has already helped so many villages across sub-saharan africa. 80villages is a lot of villages and if they all have such good progress like sauri, what makes you think we can't win the fight against poverty? to do all this across the huge area of sub-saharan africa, the millennium villages project is already a huge success.	lastly, the awesome progress of the millennium villages project has encouraged the supporters and probably increased the amount of supporters. as long as the millennium villages project keeps doing the great job they're doing now the number of supporters will keep rising and they will get more money. with more money, the project will be able to recover more villages even faster than they are now.	in conclusion, we can win the fight against poverty in our lifetime because it took such a short time to sauri to make great progress, the project has made great progress with so many

fertilization, farmers couldn’t grow food as fast and as well as they could’ve with fertilizer. no food means nothing to eat. the students had no midday meal which gave them no energy. so the help of the millennium villages project helped with that problem. help is one of the things that makes winning against poverty achievable, not saying that when you’re in a crisis like this you depend on help all the time, sometimes you just need a little push to start on the right track and you can keep going from there. that’s what the millennium villages project. now kenya is doing great. in the passage

healthy for us, like vegetables, fruits, grains, and etc, but if the farmers don’t have water and fertilizers, the crops will die easily. that won’t be nutrition to our bodies.	rebuilding and

of the main causes of death, in countires in africa such as kenya is malaria, and with the bed nets the death rate from malaria decreases and in 2008 every sleeping site is sauri had bed nets by 2015

their parents couldn't afford the school fees to send the children to school. that is very bad because childern need the eduacation	another example of poverty is that in sauri kenya that they only get one dollar per day. which makes it even harder to buy food, send their childern to school or do basically anything that involes money. poverty made/makes things hard for them. they had to raise one dollar or less to buy food for the whole family and they didn't have enogh money	if they stopped poverty, the world would be better. they have a plan to stop poverty. their plan started in 2004

believe that poverty may decrease or the idea of poverty decreasing in the work is possible, but winning the whole fight against this great problem seems rather too large a task. the millennium villages is great project, but i don’t think it will ever fully complete its goal.  in the article, it talks about ways to decrease poverty in countries like sauri, kenya. one great problem is a disease in africa, malaria, that kills up to 20,000 kids each day. there has been solutions to this problem. bed nets are what keep mosquitoes away from the sleeping people, yet the problem is not solved entirely.	another example is that the supplies are short. kids going to school in sauri cannot concentrate because of no midday meals. though, they have school supplies, like books, papers, and pencils, they are easily tired at the end of the day. so the short supply problem, is another task that is great to solve. 	in the article, it also talks about a fight for better health. when the author talks about the time she went to the yala sub-district hospital, the situation seemed worse than they thought. there weren’t enough beds for all the patients and that is another great problem they had. so i think that the situation might come down and things will get better, but there will always be a problem, always.	getting more supplies for the people in poverty, will be a lot of work. transportation, money, food, medicine, clothes, and other important things would  be hard to get and this can all make if more harder, people will need to participate and getting them to help, may be another problem. 	through the progress of the sauri people, i think poverty will certainly decrease in the world and the goal of millennium villages will come close to them. millennium villages may help many countries around the world decrease the poverty of people. but the goal will never accomplished to me.",3112501Y3_000502867.docx,"the author convinced me that beating poverty in my lifetime is possible.      for example, bed nets save lives. they only cost $5 each! the bed nets are cheap enough that a well-funded organization could save many lives each day!in my lifetime, malaria (the disease mosquitoes carry that can be prevented by bed nets) could be completely gone! without this disease hindering villages, people might be one more step closer to winning the war against poverty.     another example is how quickly sauri advanced. more people attend school, and the school serves lunch now. many medicines are being used to fight common diseases. sauri made these improvements from a dirty, unlighted hospital with no doctor or water in just four years.      my third example is hte goal of the millennium project. they thought they could raise the standard of living dramatically in just 11 years. i think this estimate of the time it would take was quite accurate, because the people working for the millennium project probably have had experience helping people and know how long it will take. so, i believe poverty can be overcome in my lifetime.",2121601Y3_000546388.docx,"hannah sachs really convinced me when she wrote this article. the idea of “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time” was proven throughout the story. for example, when the people of sauri didn’t get good health support, people helped change it in 4 years. now ther are no more charges and better medical support. many kids in sauri wanted to go to school, but school fees were pricey, but 4 years later, peole helped to make theschool fees disappear and created school lunches for students. before poele helped, farming was very hard. crops were dying because of the lack of fertilizer and as a result, sauri wasn’t getting the healhty minerals and nutrients in food that they needed in order to thrive. but 4 years later, people helped to get the people of sauri the food that they need. they gave them fertilizer, seeds, and other tools to maintain the crops. dramatic changes had occurred in 4 years in 80 villages across sub-saharan frica. all of these helpful changes had occurred thanks to the millennium villages project. maybe more

wont change the people who will steal all those things. another thing is if we keep giving kenya all this stuff people will start to depend on the united nations and once we leave it up to goverment officials it will go back to normal. that is the paradox the united states are facing we want to extract troops but we are woried that once the troops leave the middle east it will go back to the way

be helped on in africa, it should be egypt. egypt is facing a faild goverment, possibal cival war, and evry thing kenyas having. that is why this 20 year old author with a single story did not

decrease.     to conclude, the millennium villiages project has been improving the town of sauri in kenya. the yala sub-district hospital now has water, electricity, and free medicine. schools in

also feed the kids. after they sell parents can get some money to pit kids in school again. i also believe the author convinced me because the next day some more people will donate a dollar a day and they can use that to buy nets for the sick in the hospitals. i also think proverty gets better by the minute because in the passage it said dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages all over sub-saharan africa. so when one village is helped, they can also improve to help their familys who are in different places thats how we can all help to prevent poverty because one good always lead to another like mostly getting fertilizer and water because people can use the grown crops to sell and help pay bill, school fees and medicine bills. this is why i believe soon poverty will be finished

water, no electricity, so the milleinem vilalge project gave them ranning water and gave funding support. they farmerss also were worried that they could irrigate their crops with little water and fertlized farming alnd. so the milleiniem village project taught farming, gave water,a nd fertilzier that gives fertilie land for plants to grow. then they saw that there were few kids in schools teaching the fature generation to have a better future. plus the schools had fees that few families could pay and the schools had few supplies of books, pencils, apper,a nd they didn’t have lunch or a mid-day meal. so they gave money and sapplies to the school for lunch, no fees, and supplies. the attendence sky rocketed. all these simple solutions in 4 years changed the whole city thanks to the

years.",31041_020070546.docx,"based on the article, the author did convice us that winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime. here are the three examples the author used in the text.	in the beginning, most of the farmers had no money to afford any fertilizer or irrigation. in africa, they also lack of water. because of these reasons many of their crops were dying. but depend on the millennium villages project. they had made amazing progress in just four years: water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity.	at first, many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not pay the school fees and the kids also had to help their families to work on some house chores. the kids could not go to school, so many of them did not even know how to writing. one generation became stupider than one generation. but finally, others contributed school supplies and money for kids to learn. the attendance rate is way up.	in about 2004 when the author went to visit africa, there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed in the hospital. the rooms were packed with patients who would not receive treatment and the most horrible thing was there wasn’t any doctors. diseases were spread around, many people died and get sick. after about 4 years, people get better and better. water connected running through hospital.",41291_020028719.docx,"moilanen_020028719i think the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achivible in our life time. life in sauri has gotten much better over the pass years with the help of the millennium villages project. big problems in the sauri community are things like farms, the hospital, and the school. farmers did not have nessasary water and fertilizer. hospitals were packed and most pacients could not be treated cause the hospital didn’t have the things or the people couldn’t afford it. schools lacked paper, pencils, books, and supplies. kids did not focus cause there was no midday meal. by the end of the day kids were tired and had no energy. over time farmers got better firtization and more irrigation for more and better crops. hospitals now has have medicine, free of charge for all kinds of diseases. schools now have no school fee and also serve out midday meals for the students. this has convince me that provity in sauri is achivable in life.",4106502Y2_000519239.docx,"this passage desribes sauri, kenya. the author did provide a convincing argument that ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime. i feel like i should help the sauri people get most of their needs. mu understanding is that the kenya people need help the most. they need shoes, new clothing, clean water, electricity, free education, school supplies, bed nets, supporters, more crops, fertilizer, and medicine. it seems that the kenya people don't have enough of their needs. the evidence in the text to increse the question is that he wrote a paragraph that convinced me that he was going to fight against proverty. my reason for stating this is because the sauri people need help and we need to help them. it is my thought that they should give the sauri people more money than one dollar a day. in 2008 the sauri people made an amazing progress injust four years. the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases. my closing statement is that the sauri people are kind of safe and they have enough needs to survive and stay in sauri, kenya. they have more bed nets to keep the mosquitos away from the sauri people.",2127501Y1_000493010.docx,"before the millennium villages project kenya, africa was horrible. they didn’t have water, electricity, medicine, no fertilizer for their crops, bed nets, or tools. kids could not even go to school because their parents could not afford it. after the millennium villages project kenya, africa became much better. they now have bednets, water, electricity, medicine, fertilizer for their crops, and tools. so i think the author thinks it’s important for kids to learn about how life in kenya before and after the millennium villages project because we need to know about how people live in other parts of the world and maybe one day we can make a difference. they improved their school attendance because they took off the school fee. now more kids can go to school and get an education. changes have occured in 80 other villages across sharan africa. the millenium villages project encouraged other villages to do the same thing. before they had bednets 20,000 kids died from malarial each day. their plan was to assure the access to health care and help stabalize the economy and quality of life in their communities. their hospital’s were so bad they had to fit three children to one bed and two adults on another bed. the rooms were packed with people who probadly would not even get treated. they had no doctors, only a runnig water. the girl said “it was hand for her to see people near to death when they shouldn’t have to be”. there was no medicine because the hospital could not afford it. the farmers crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. a family would plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of water and fetiler. every year farmers worry. if they harvest enough food to feed their whole family or will their kids go hungry and become sick. some reasons kids could not go to school is because they had to help with chores, such as fetching water and wood. the schools had minimal supplies such as books, paper, and pencils. the students wanted to learn as much as they could. they all worked hard even with the few supplies they had. it was hard for the kids to concentrate because there was no midday meal. at the end of each school day the kids had no energy. so the millennium villages project dramatically helped the people in africa.",31182_020012774.docx,"yes, it might be possible to end poverty in sauri, kenya within this lifetime. however the effects of poverty aren't limited to that village,

asia, and even in countries like switzerland, england, france, belguim, netherlands, germany, austria, luxemburg, and liechteinstien. (icould go on but i don't want to.) sure their cases of poverty aren't as extreme but there are still homeless and very poor people there who can't afford to eat. it maybe possible to wipe out poverty in sauri within this lifetime since they progressed so much in those past four years. 	in sauri the people helping there practically rebuilt the place, fertilizer and tools to ward off starvation. free medicine and bed nets help kill disease there. irragation systems and electricty generators help the hospitals mand make there quality of life better. there are no school fees and served lunch for the students so more kids attend class.	my point being these changes have been made in 80 villages there. so the millennium villages project might be able to wipe out poverty for 100(s) of

understanding is “a better life.” in this paragraph the author explains the after affect that the m.v.p has had on the impovershed village of sauri. for instance in past paragraphs she explained her experience in sauri and seeing children in tattered clothes on the streets and people in the clinics that could not afford treatment to very treatable diseases of the hospital unfortunetly did not have the equipment to heal them. she then says that after m.v.p supplied them with medical treatment and bed nets to prevent the most common of theeir illnesses(malaria) which they could get from

problems. one of them is malaria, a disease that can cause death to children and severe illness to adults. malaria is carried by malarian mosquitos. twenty thousand kids die from this each day. but

hospitals are in a bad shape and a lot of people are sick. and some of them can't afford it, because they only get 1 dollar a day. they need the money for food and other things. the other one is that farmers are afraid that their crops wouldn't grow and there wouldn't be enough to feed their family. because they couldn't afford any fertilizer and water. many kids in sauri can't attend school because they can't pay for the school fees. and the school doesn't have enough food to eat in the midday. the last one is that the people in sauri are making progress in four years. the people who are sick don't have to pay anymore when they go to the hospitals. now there is water and a generator to provide electricity. now the farmers have fertilizer and seeds, as well as tools for maintaining the food supply. now more children can go to schools because they don't have to pay fees anymore. and the schools are serving food in the afternoon, it takes time to get rid of proverty. because there are

couldnt afford it. before there was no doctor & no water or electricity. another example in change is education. now there are no school fee’s and the school provides lunches for the students. as apposed to minimal school suplies school fee’s and no meals as before. more & more students are going & the attendance rate is going up. the last dramatic change is bed nets. malaria is one disease common in africa. mosquitoes carry malaria & can infect people by bitting them. a bed net, treated with chemicals that last for 5 years keep malarial mosquitoes away from sleeping people. each net

chance of them dieing. or maybe geting sick. in kenya there are alot of farmers. alot of kids don't go to school because they got to farm. there not a lot of school because they know that kids farms. there are alot of kid that farm more then they go to school. and the kids that go to school do not have books or paper, pencils. but the students want to learn. but without those many supplies. when

poverty, and assure them access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities and that’s what happened and accomplished have of it, but everyday there is making a change. and putting there part in it. another example is that in the article it said that about 80 dramatic changes have occurred in villages across sub-saharan africa i infer if we all work

children we get all of that from my parents.  they work to get the oney and from the money we get all the supplies that we need at home or for school.  it is also true because in kenya with $40 they could be rich.  maybe even the richest people in kenya out in our life time when we get a lot of money the kids waist it on chips, candy, and other junk food.  the aulduts waist it on a bunch of stuff that they don’t even need.  but what we all have to think about is look at what other people have to go through in order to get at least $1 dollar.  so instead of taking advantage we should think about what  we do instead of just doing it.  when we get food its the same thing because when we eat we don’t get hungry and then we just through it away.  we should think about the people who want food but they cant get none because they don’t have enough of no money at all.  people die because they cannt get any food at all.  we should be thankful for the stuff we get because people are in the

going acheive poverty then i know in my lifetime we can acheive to. for ex.) when parents couldn’t afford school fee, we should be able to fight that and how they needed bed nets cost $5 and we can’t afford that we should really try hard because if we really can’t afford nothing 5% that means we really in poverty, and how hospital beds have to be shared and people getting sick we should have a cure for that when we meet our goals, proverty can end so the goal was to be able to get fertilizer medicine and school supplies by 2015 and i think the goals they are doing they are going to achieve that. one more thing, we can stop malaria from not letting children get bit up by mosquitoes put bug spray in them so the can’t get sick and die, kids can die from it easily, and aduts can get very sick so thats why proverty need to end so we can be achievable and be able to have enough money for needs. so i think poverty will stop eventually.",2139691Y3_000524667.docx,"yes because (1) if we do

that have malaria, but the only problem is that they cost five dollars, but because of the fight every sleeping sight has a bed nets. before people couldn’t afford letting their kids go to school because it was expensive and too top that off they didn’t even have a lunch period, but now school is free and the kids can go eat lunch that the school provides “there are no school fees and the school now provides a lunch”. when the fight began the farm lands wern’t fertile crops would die and the crops wouldn’t get enough water either, because of the fight they now have fertilizer and tons

health care.  there was no doctor.  it was 2 adults in one bed and 3 kids in one bed too.  another example family couldn’t afford things.  some kids couldn’t afford to go to school because of the school fee .one more example family couldn’t eat because they didn’t have fertilizer.  family couldn’t afford that either.  children would be hungery because there was no food to be planted.  when the kids go to school they have no energy because the children didn’t get an mid day meal.  but in 2008 everything changed sauri people could afford things and children had mid day meals at school and they had food.  there are doctors in hospital.  there’s no more school fees.,31182_020014120.docx,"no, the author did not convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. my reason for that is because, ending poverty all over completely is a very difficult task and it might take extremely long. 	however, the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable. i think this because, when i looked back at the article, i remembered that from 2004-2008, sauri had made great improvements. for example, in 2004, a hospital had no water, no electricity, high costs, and not much space. but by 2008, they had an affordable price for citizens. they also got water and even got a generator for electricity. 	another example is the bed nets. in 2004, not a lot of people could afford these, but now they can. every sleeping sight in sauri uses bed nets. it has saved a lot of lives. 	also, in 2004, hunger was a huge crisis for people in sauri. but now, people are supplied with tools to maintain a healthy food supply. also includes seeds and fertilizer. their schools have no fees and provides lunch for the students, and many children now attend school.",41431_020009598.docx,"yes, i think poverty can be possible because she convinced me that if they can make good progress in 4 years like free charge of medicine, in 40 that is a lot of time. in the article, it says they can’t afford supplies, water, or energy. if we all starts donating to kenya, they might be able to make it a better place. it also says that some families can’t afford to go to school. maybe if they do it like united states, it could be free. in 2008, the process is very good like how they have medicine for all common diseases. if the people get to hungrey, they can fertilized the crops to make it grow faster. the bed nets are now used in sauri.	it is very sad to me that 20,000 kids die of the diseases each day. i think the bugs or mosquitoes had something to do with this. a way i think that would help the cause is to get a spray or a net to kill it. the hospitals should come to kenya and check out what sickness they are suffering from. if they can do it for hati, they come to kenya too.	the farmers are worried that the crops would die out so they need packs of fertilizers to help them not starve to death. kids don’t have the energy to play around because they can’t afford food. i can imagine the people to be really skinny. it makes me want to help them because i feel very bad for them.",21401_020070611.docx,"the

people around the world are failing to reach a brighter future to life. like mellenium villages project, i agree on how one organization can change many people's lives. from food source's increase rate, to hospitality, to school and education. many people aorund the world have certain problems like kenya's, but that situation can be fixed.	food sources in some areas of the world are scarce and hard to product or find. hunting for animals can be difficule, and some parts of the world cannot allow hunting! meat is a vialble need for people, and if those people poverty cannot get the meat they need, starvation may occur. there are many areas of the world that can make farming for food difficult, so that really affects people like from kenya, lose an important part of their diet. if special organizations , like the mellenium villages projects, could hlp with plantation and food sources, this could really help people in need,	hospitals are not always filled with the best doctors and medicine can be hard to produce and find. if there are doctors that can be employed to hospitals near people in need, death and diseease rates would definetly decrease. people around the world have hearts, that are land enough to make donations for people in need. bed nets could be produced more and used to lower the causes of spreading disease, mosquitoes and other insects that spread diseases.	people who are more educates and made more educational classes can help the world too! children that are educated can become something that might change the world. people educated enough to graduate can become a doctor that helps the hospitals, a teacher that educated a group of other children at skill, or maybe even help create a government for the people in need.	the conclusion

millennium village project.	the hospitals had no eletricity, no water, and no medicine. if you went there it meant you were probably going to die. but the people of the millennium project steped in and gave it a power generator, free medicine, and connected water to the building. 	the schools had no lunch period, low amount of educational supplies and many could not afford to go. and again the people of the millennium progect stepped in. they gave enough food for lunch, enough school supplies, like books or pencils, and schools no longer needed fees so kids could learn for free.	the village’s agriculture was also bad before the project. it needed more water so crops wouldn’t wither, it needed fertilizer so crops would grow better. after the four years of support from the millennium project they had enough food and water for everyone in the village. 	with all that i have told you, i think that we can stop poverty from many places just like sauri, but it will take

convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable because with great struggle comes a new life when people come to help you. 	in 2004 when sachs went to the hospital in kenya, she saw terrible things. for example, “the hospital was packed with patients who couldn’t get treatment either because there wasn’t any or they couldn’t afford it.” (4) this explains even though there were patients, some couldn’t get treated because of money or limited supply. this connects to my thesis because the people were in poverty.	when she went to the farms, there were also disasters. for example, “their crops were dying because they couldn’t afford the necessary fertilizer & irrigation.”(7) that meant that their families could starve & get sick. this connects to my thesis because they were in poverty.	the millennium villages project created by the united nations helped kenya. progress in 4 years was amazing, the people there were living better. for example, “hospitals had water & electricity, homes had food and nets, & schools have no fees & serve lunch.”(7) this means that the united nations provided the people in kenya everything they needed. now they live with little struggle & more happiness. 	i assert that poverty can be crushed when others give up their time to help & create better lives. in this writing, all i said is that the people from kenya were struggling with life until the united nations came. i conclude that everybody struggles in their lives, but at the end there is always another person to pick you up & lift the weight off your shoulders.",31131_020013263.docx,"fighting poverty is a very difficult task not only in sauri, but in other places as well. in order to end poverty, you must get money from other countries, and i don’t think most people know about the poor places in the world. the article listed a few examples about sauri’s economy, but also said that within a few years they were able to improve their economy. they set their goal for around 10 year, and i don’t think it’s enough time to end poverty. 	according from the article, “20,000 kids die from this disease each day.” it states that around 20,000 kids die from maleria every day. that’s a lot of people! not only kids die, but adults also go through this crisis. one way to treat this horrible disease would be to use bed nets. bet nets are able to save million of live, yet they are too costly and people are unable to afford them. the solution to fighting maleria is simple to us, but possibly impossible for the people in sauri.	another crisis that the people in sauri have to face would be their school fees. i believe that children should be able to walk into a school and use as much utencils as they want and to learn as much as possible to get ready for the future. sadly, the children in sauri are unable to do this due to the limited supplies and the expensive school fees. the students want to learn but they are unable to do that since it’s hard for them to concentrate because they didn’t get any midday meal, therefore they wouldn’t have enough energy for class. 	it is really hard living in sauri. on top of having numerous deaths each day and a bed education, it is just a very unpleasant place to live in. women sit on the dusty ground and sell bananas. little kids would wear tattered clothes and walk around barefoot, having bananas on dusty grounds may spread bacteria and tattered clothes would cause the children to catch a cold. 	for these are the reasons why i believe ending poverty is a difficult task, and it may take more than 10 years. it is not an impossible task, since there were many improvements overtime. if people are determined to help out sauri, poverty would end it no time. but for now, there is still a lot to do, and many other places that needs help to end poverty.",3106601Y2_000547159.docx,"yes, this artical did convince me that winning the fight against poverty in our time because in the

food and water you’ll need for you wife and children. if you pack food and store it untill the war you will be prepared to just take it and you wont have to worry about packing it at the last minute in 2015. the next example is medicine. you’ll need medicine because of the malaria disease that is going around killing kids and getting adults very ill/sick.	since the artical said that the hospitals are not very good like the beds have to normaly fit 3 kids and 2 adults. and we have 11 more years until the war comes so we can try to acheive the goal to make better hospitals.	another

poverty, but the goals are set for years away. many people will not make it to see the end of poverty. that also means that some people that are important fo reachign the gaols will be lost and less progress will be made. i believe that if there are many small goals,a nd different people assigned to different tasks, it would be assured that the most important goals would be met. 	the author also told me that they visited a hospital, and it was not in good shape. many people din’t have healthcare or enough money to pay for treatments. i don’t think that america should be sending people to solve this problem until we’ve fixed our own healthcare crisis. so, i think that it will be a while before the problems in kenya are fixed. 	another reason that i believe that these problems won’t be fixed soon is because the author said that malaria is a disease that kills many people in africa. th solutions bed nets and cheap medicines are unaffordable to may africans. it would take many people to work together to create affordable healhtcare, and to give jobs that pay higher wages. and that doesn’t seem realistic because many nations would have to work together. rivals would have ot become alleis in the war against poverty. i don’t believe that many of thse countries would want to work together, even for a good cause. 	one last reason why i don’t think that this is chievable in my lifetime is because kenya isn’t the only impoverished country in the world. there are possibley hundreds of other ocuntries without proper resources. i don’t believe that my lifetime or our lifetime is enough time to get rid of the extreme poverty issues in this world. many places such as kenya, india, indonesia, nigeria, afganistan and other palces need seriosu help and our lifetime, no matter how hard we try, is enough to out it. 	however, in hopes of closing this on a good note, poverty can be ended. the best thing to do is to try. i wouldn’t expect you to go to india andimprove water conditions yoruself. however, you could find a local organizaiton that sends financial aid to third world countries and make an effort to support them. or you could donate to these places yourself and begin your won non profit organization. the author said that it would take “the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good”. even though that may take awhile, it doesn’t mean

have to share a bed. the patients also didn’t get the treatment that they needed. there was also no running water or electricity. but in 2008, there was a big difference because the patients were free of charge. you didn’t have to pay to go to school, farmers were supplied with fertilizer and seeds, in every sleeping site there are bed nets. and in schools, they serve free school lunches.",3106502Y3_000532256.docx,"the author hannah sachs did prove that winning the fight againt poverty is achieable because in 2004 the schools did not have no lunches, no school suplies, and the school fee was not free so they had to pay money, they could not pay for that.  so hannah tried to prevent this by settling and by bringing people from other states and bringing money to the millennium villages so they can but ever thing they needed.  in 2008 the people in millennium villages had every thing they needed in school such as: school suplies, lunches, and even the school was free so kids were able to go to school.in 2004 hostpitals did not have any doctors, electricty or water.  they were not in good shape.  there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed.  the rooms were packed with patients who probably would not have been received any type of treatment because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it.  in 2008 the hostpitals had many doctors, their electricty was working so was their water.  they had alot of rooms so the children had their own rooms and beds aswell as the adults.in 2004 the farmers plants were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilzer and irrigation.  people were worryed because they do not know if their children will get sick.  it caused them to be worried because people were spraying fertilzer were on the fruit/food: (that can really harm the children.)  in 2008 they were not spraying any more fertilzer to harm the crops any more.  adults were not worried any more because the crops, food, fruit, or vegetables have not been sprayed by fertilzer any more so the children were not getting sick.  also in 2004 worms and many other types of bugs have gotten into the

were more high-tech hospitals, diseased people could get proper care. that way, there could be less death, and people could strive in their own land.    another issue that must be addressed us lack of food. once people start providing fertilizer and helping to build irrigation systems in areas without food, people can eat and live. also, water can improve cleanliness and personal hygiene     one other thing that must be improved u education. schools everywhere should provide mid-day meals to students. they should also have enough supplies for all. then, the students' future could be

everybody deserves. with the help of shoe stores we can give the people of africa unused models that people may destpertly need. with the help of consturtion workers that arn’t busy they can help

example sariu, kenya don’t have it easy. the woman and children ware tattered clothing and sell stuff at a market on the ground. but then there came a millennium project who wanted to help the people. here are some examples of hospital ways: 3 kids or 2 adults to a bed, no doctors, and now water or electricity. the one grallem desease was malaria each day 20,000 lives were lost, this disease is given off by mosqitos. some people dont even get food because there was no fertilizer or iragation which didnt allaws the crops to grow. and because of that the kids were not given midday meal in school. the kids didnt even have enough supplies like books, pencail, paper. some kids didnt even go to school. but because of the millennium praject life in sariu, kenya is a very healthy life style. here are some examples of the ways the praject helped kenya. at first the hospital was horrible it had nothing but later in life changes came and now the hospital has water, electricity, and medicine. fore the school all of the kids know had no fee, all kids get lunch naw. that was something good they did so know they may get a good education just like me. the 2 things that were really needed were fertilizer and irrigation once they have gotten that there were crops growing and the effect on this is family no longer have to starve for food every day. all of this hard work was done by the milleniun praject just to makethe people in sariu, kenya lives better and naw many families dont have to lose family members due to malaria all, because this praject gave them bed nets. not only did

just read. i say this because of the things we can do, the global effort, and the current change in kenya. 	the effect describe din paragraph 3, shows the things being done to help poverty stricken regions in kenya. this paragraph sows that there are many ways poverty can be resolved in an systematic way. the millenium village project gave ""technical advice and practical items such as fertilizer, medicine and school supplies"", to the needing people in kenya. this action, alone, gave many people hope and a fighting chance to live a normal, happy life. if actions such as described in the article, greatly helps , there must be so much more that can be done to make the world a better place. 	the reason why the millenium village is such a success, based on teh comments made by the author is the idea of helping the less fortunate people in the world. this drive has led to many, resolutions in famine, poverty, agriculture, and disease. and since so many people wanted to help this cause and led to a revolution in kenya. simply by giving the supplies that they could provide into the poor, they helped poor villages so that now they could support themselves. 	what has already happened in kenya can describe the change that we can do, for future generations. when the millennium village project gave bed nets to sleeping areas in kenya, it helped stop mosquitoes from carrying malaria to adults or children. if we, continue to do so, and the events in the article continue to assur, then we may solve the malaria epidemic that should not have been there in the first place. another example is in the first paragraph under the heading ""water; fertilizer, knowledge,"" where the author describes the change in agriculture has helped so many villages. if these changes continue to occur then famine will no longer be a problem in kenya. as the author descrived in the article, these are only two things, out of many, that are being done to help poverty stricken areas for the future. 	in conclusion, this is why based ont he reasons just stated the article ahs convinced me that poverty in kenya can be resolved in my lifetime because of the things we can do. the

time four is two-hundred so that will take a really long while. 	second reason many people need help and they don’t have much time before that state or country have no more people are living there or long gone. that will be a little too late. even when hannah thought kenya is in a bad envirment.	third reason people are not going raise enough money because 50 states and there are a lot of countries in one state. they will take a really long time and that place that raised the money to save that country will have proverty.	fourth reason if people keep on saving money for other countries and become having proverty proverty will be going on for a very long time or as i will say it will be going on and for ever. proverty is very hard to prevent from happening to every country to country. 	fifth reason it will be hard doing the right think if it might happen to you afterward. proverty makes thing hard for people to live for example kenya only earn $1 a day and they can’t find the money for themselve plus there child. 	these are the five reasons why proverty might be still going on while even when i turn 70. not that i don’t believe but its just a prediction if i’m

enough? it all basically comes back down to the main question: can we win the fight against poverty?",1128601Y2_000480534.docx,"the author taught me that if you all work together as a team, you can achieve something more thatn you expect. for example, when the story says ‘there are bed nets for everyone, there is enough water for crops, there is lunch at school and no fee, and when the story says there is no pay for medicine and there is a lot of medicine tells me that everybody worked together to make all of this happen. i really think that if the government was thoughtful instead of selfish, then the people in kenya would have a better place before the year of 2008. if i was in charge of the government, i would take care of the people who need help and take care of me last. that’s the thoughtful person i am. i would really hate to see people die in front of their loved ones. that is why i want to help. i want everybody to be satisfied with their life. i am happy that kenya has a better life now or else everybody could have been sick with maleria. but, now that everybody worked together, their lives are a lot better. i think that the author, hannah sachs wanted to

will still occur in the future, evidence i have to support this, maybe because the government would not have enough money to feed everyone. poverty is severe, people have experienced deaths from it. another evidence i have to support my answer is, well poverty is all over the world and charitys might not get there, poverty is still all over the earth and charitys help by donating food, water, blankets, and other certain materials. poverty might never stop since some countries are struggling with money budgets. also, some countries don’t much food and poverty occurs in that certain place. charitys are all over the world to help places with poverty. you can help fight poverty by donating. some places have less medicine or less school materials. donating to charitys is a big help, so if you have a few extras go donate to a charity and you’ll be helping!! i think poverty is very risky for lives, people all around the world every year die from: hunger, diseases, and water shortage. giving medicine to hospitals are very helpful, so patients can get healed or feel better faster and faster. building schools and handing food will be great for children and parents. schools shouldn’t be charged to go to school. education is important, so no more school fees! parents work very very hard to let their kids have an education, because their kids mean it all to them. starting a charity will also help. people all around the world still struggling through hunger and water shortage. the world needs to stop poverty. it’s not fair that we get mostly every thing, and poor countries out there don’t. some parents even work all day just to get a bed net for their kids, so they don’t get malaria. malaria is also a severe disease. bed nets costed $5, that’s at least a weekly salary!

meal. they have little huts or none of all to sleep in. children who couldn’t afford school had to do chores with their parents. they did such as fetching water and wood, so they could live. these people don’t deserve this, no one does! we could help stop this!! some countries are grateful to have food, water and electricity. also grateful they could go to schools without paying school fees. some are also grateful to have doctors and medicine to cure sickness and diseases.",21432_020013777.docx,"the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our

medicines that are proven to cure diseases like this may not seem like much, but i remember reading about an award winning book called “fever” and it was about the disease malaria. it was a story with fictional characters, but it still included much information about malaria. 	aside for the hospitals now having a care to sicknesses like malaria, there are now bed nets in every area of sauri, as it says after the free medicine. just to think that these people in this place that used to have hardly any treatment, no doctors, no water or electricity, malaria infected mosquitos, dying crops, few school supplies, it’s an amazing comparison when you think about think about how many people have been helped, how many problems have been fixed. (the fight for better health/water, fertilizer, knoledge.) now, they also have bed nets that will literally “not let the bed bugs bite.” people much feel so much more relieved to know that they have better safety and protection while they’re sleeping. 	so, now people have medicine, they have sleep, but they also need food. that problem has been adressed, too. after the author talks about medicine and bed nets, they say that they now have fertilizer, seeds, and tools to grow better crops and keep them under control. this is a very important problem and it has been adressed and fixed. 	all of it adds up to a better life. i mean, the problems aren’t fully fixed and there’s much more poverty in the world. but, this a good start and the author clearly states that many things have been changed for the better in sauri. we are most definately capable of doing more work. we just all need to work together. millenium villiages has definately proved that we can make big improvement

out of proverty. another reason for this is because if the children go hungry they might get sick, so they’ll have to go to the hospital, but there is no water or electricity provided so, what will

millennium villages project is to get people out of poverty, assure them access to healthcare, and help them stabalize the economy and quality of life in their communities. kenya just happens to be one of the poverty areas of the world. in the time frame of about 15-20 years, comparing what we've already got done and what needs to be done, this dream can totally come true. the millennium villages project completed their mission on kenya and i suppose they will continue, all around the world.	hannah wrote in her first conclusive paragraph that in just 4 years, dramatic changes have occured as a result of the millennium villages project's complete mission, in sauri. after stating all the previously serious, unfixed problems like the education and healthcare, she went ahead to say that all those problems have been fixed in just 4 years. if you look at it from an angle, that is a really, really big accomplishment. it really has made a better life for kenyans.	in the second paragraph of the same section, hannah says that the millennium villages project has not only helped kenya, but also 80 other villages in sub-saharan africa. like she said, thought it won't be an easy job, it would take a worldwide effort to make the world (everywhere on earth) a much better place to live in the aspect of living comfortably and healthy in any environment. if you see it the way i do, diminishing poverty in areas like sauri, kenya won't be a hard job as long as we have determination, inspiration, and faith to believe that this can really happen. nobody on earth deserves to suffer from poverty, especially if it can easily be solved with common resources. i don't know about you, but i really do believe we can make this happen. poverty can lead to death and this is not ok!

proverty go down. it is achievable in are lifetime because we have the technology and knowledge to be able to figure out how to make peoples life better. we could donate money to all the poor people in the world. if sauri, kenya can find a new way to make life easier for the poor, it will help so many people. in paragraph 4, they had so many sick people wh probably will die very soon and not get the treatment they need to survive. in paragraph 3, it explanes many ways sauri, kenya could escape from proverty. 	if everyoen supports each other, they will soon get to finish their goal for better life. the vilalges will get adivce on how to make life better. if we donate food and medicine to all over sauri, kenya they will surely get the thigns they ened. in paragraph 6, it says there are very simple ways for people to treat or prevent malaria. but because many people don’t hve the suppleis they need so many kids die form the disease. since everyone in sauri, kenya did everythgin they could to make life better more people can get medicine and the treatment they need. so many kids are now in school and less peole live on the street. but they still have a lot to do if they want to make sauri, kenya a better place for people. 	one thing i would like to point out is that she said the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime. to me this means that before in the olden days they didn’t have the right materials to help people out of proverty. today we have the technology and advanced methods that we can use to help sauri, kenya achieve there goals. before they didn’t have the advanced technology we have today. it would probably be harder for them to fight proverty with the the type of skills they ahd before. we will be able to win the battle more quicke then the people before. 	kenya has really improved between the years o 2004 and 2008. schools no longer change fees and now serve lucnh. more farms get the fertilizer they need to have great farms. yet stil there is

get out of poverty, access to health care, help them stabilize the economy, get them feritilizer, get them medicine and school supplies. before that project the people of sauri didn't have much of nothing. at their hospital they were only 3 children to a bed, and 2 adults to a bed. the room was filled with patients but most couldn't afford it, or the hospital didn't have it. there were no doctors just a clinical officer running the hospital. there was no water or electricity.	a disease common in africa is malaria. a pest that carries malaria are mosquitoes. something that prevents

patients. the hospital didn't have enought treatment for all the patients and the prices were also high, but after 4 years, the hospital has medicine for the more common dieseases, water, and electricity. also, the article said that farmers were worried about not having good crops. this is important because they sell their crops for money and use the crops to feed their family. after the millewnium villages' project work the families have much better crops because they gave the fertilizer and tools to keep the crops going so the families can sell and eat. another reason hannah (the author) convinced me is because in the article its said that most kids couldn't go to school because they didn't have school supplies, money for school fees, and the parents needed the kids to do chores and help out. kids that went to school were alway tired after school because they didn't get a mid-day snack. later on, there were no school fees, the kids got lunch, and the attendance rate

are really important because we all have some medical issues and some people don’t have enough money to pay their medical costs. there are homeless people and they dont have money to pay their homes

yet not many people did much until 2004. a whole group of people traveled to sauri and they all made a difference. they made remarkable changes for the better. what those people did was truly

project has such an inspiring message and goal. if more people were to aknowledge their message we could get 1,000 or more people to join. this project would take a lot of work, so you can’t just set a deadline for when it is going to be accomplished. you have to work progessly and together instead of rushing. $1 a day, 112 million children can’t have a proper education, and 1 in 30 people die

everywhere; and there are many medications for taking care of the most common diseases in that region. seems pretty similar to our community, right? but, it wasn’t always this way in sauri, kenya. i’m writing this essay to show how kenya looked before and after the mellenium development goals. so, here’s what sauri was like before. first, the millenium development goals so some could be met by 2015, some by 2025. but, there was still a lot of work to do. the hospitals were very dirty. there was three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed, and most of the patients couldn’t be treated either because they didn’t have the money, or the hospital didn’t have the supplies to help them. there was no doctor, just a clinical officer running the hospital, and there was no running water or electricity. sadly, most of the people are in the hospital for small diseases that can be helped like malaria, a common disease in kenya caused by mosquito bites. there is room for improvement.another problem that was there had to deal with farming. lots of crops were dying because the farmers couldn’t afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. again and again, a family will plant seeds and have no good outcome because of the loss of fertilizer and irrigation. and most families only plant enough seeds to feed themselves. so, a lot of the time farmers are worrying whether they are able to provide for their family. another problem is about conditions of the schools. many kids can’t attend schools because their parents couldn’t afford the school fees. others couldn’t attend school because some kids are needed to help with chores, like fetching water and wood. the schools had minimal supplies, such as books, paper, and pencils, but, through the circumstances, they wanted to learn. but it was hard for the students to concentrate because there was no lunch. so, by the time the students got home, they were exhausted. so, sauri, kenya has really over the last five years. before things looked pretty impossible. but, poverty is a really bad thing and in that region, we are close to beating it. we have 5 years until 2015, but sauri has gone a long way. that proves that anywhere and everywhere that has poverty, we can and will beat it.",4106691Y2_000472418.docx,"no and yes because i don't like thinking that someday we are going to

already been fixed, so other's can be fixed too. 	my first reason that proverty will end in kenya is the millennium village project are providing better food and medical supplys. this is a major factor to influence sustainable surrival through-out an area. food provides energy for people, so they cna live and mediicnes protect people from sickenesses and diseases. the main reason sfor death in kenya based ont he articla is a lack of food and medications. so with more of these supplys, more kenyan people will survive live better. secondly, the progres sof the fight for proverty is moving around kenya. all the supply sand support that help people live are bieng brought to different areas. some of the main support that helps is the free food, medicines and education. this will

nations just by donating a few dollars so the yala sub-district hospital could afford treatment for patients, running water and electricity. maybe even doctors. just by donating five dollars we can help prevent the disease malaria so people in proverty can afford bed nets.another example is the farming and education. the farmers have crops that are dying because of the lack of fertilizer and water. if we keep donating and helping we could help farmer afford fertilizer, interigation and water so they could harvest enough crops to get money for their familys to eat.	the article says “most kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford school fees” and “in 2004, the school had minimal supplies like books, paper, and pencils, but the students wanted to learn”.

mosquitoes and that they had carried malaria and people made bed nets that would keep away mosquitoes since they come out at night.  the people could not afford to buy this.  because of the millennium villages project the people can now have better lives because now they can afford treatment for people who need it and afford treatment for people who need it and afford those bed nets and it was a

to work together. i can support my answer because in the last paragraph it said it won't be easy and i know that if everybe dy works together and takes part in helping out we can save millions of lifes. another reason i know this is achievable is becaue when it was 2008 suri, kenya was already starting to improve on their economy. i think if we continue helping out they will be even better then they were in 2008. they will get better houses more medicine, fertilizer so that the farmers can plant better foods and vegetables nd also get them more school supplies so that their students can learn better. another reason i know inning the fight is achievable is because we have helped lots of othewr countrys and they improved, like how we helped hati. and that is how the author convinced me

malaria. mosquitoes carry malaria. they pass it to people by bitting them. 20,000 kids die from malaria each day. a brighter future is a better life and better health. poverty means to be poor or have no money. people can end poverty. ending poverty is easy. in 2004 hannah sachs visited the millenium villages project in kenya, a country in africa. while they was there they saw people that were bare footed and had tattered clothing. the country that they went to had poverty. she felt bad for the people. the millennium villages project was created to help reach the millennium development

couldn’t fix but in just a short 4 years, many problems have been solved and even better than it needs to with the millennium village project.	in 2004, the hospital has no medicine but if they did have it the patients can’t even buy it because they don’t have enough money, but in 4 years when the millennium village project was done the hospital had enough medicine for everyone and it is also free so the patients that are sick don’t have to worry about a thing.	also malaria was a huge problems for the people too. mosquitoes go in the houses when everyone is asleep and bite them so that is how they get malaria. there are easy ways to stop it but 20,000 children die from it each day. there is something called a bed net that keeps mosquitoes away with chemicals but it cost $5 and the people usually just use $1 per day for their food. after the millennium village project was done every house/sleep site has a bed net to protect them from the mosquitoes in sauri.	also the farmer’s crop were all dying because of the lack of water and proper fertilizer. every time the farmer plants a seed, the outcome is always poor crops. in 2008 all the crops were in good shape because they had water, perfect fertilizer and even the proper tools to maintain the food supply.	in 2004 the schools didn’t have enough materials such as books, paper and pencils and there were very less children in

“little kids were wrapped in cloth on their mother’s back, or running in bare feet and tattered clothing (tattered torn or ragged)”. so that had caught my mind about how they don’t have the money like i do and i know that because hannah said “at that time the people of sauri lived on less than $2 dollar a day.” so that made me think of all of the terrible things in my world and how i am just not do something when i should because i have a parent that can take me to a hospital that probably always had water and electricity in their when other people are in their, and there are more than a clinical officer like there are doctor’s and nurses in their that can cure people. also like how i have parent that can afford to pay my school fees like she said that “many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford school fees. some kids are needed to help with chores, such as fetching water and wood.” i do have chores to do to at home and my parents always provides things that need and some things i want and im greatful that my parents can afford things that i will need when i grow up like an education. i definently need that when i grow up. so basically what i’m saying is that when she said “when my kids are my age, iw ant this kind of poverty to be a thing of history. it will not be an easy task. but she is wright it will not be a easy

that, “the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases.” jessica sachs is trying to say that before there was no medical treatments or medicine in

farmers. their crops were dying because they could not afford the neccessary fertilizer and irrigation.” jessica is trying to say that the society in sauri was very poor. yes society in sauri was poor

because people have the right to live with their natural needs met.	first, to win against poverty we have to unite. we can work together to donate money to programs that help fight poverty in places that is needed. for example if everybody in the u.s gives one dollar that owuld be a lot of money to help fight poverty. if we unitre it owuld be much more easier to eradicate poverty that for small

and a electric generator and medicine” i thought to myself that most of the world will be out of poverty. its also might not end poverty because maybe they won’t grow that big. i think that because when it said “dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa”, i remembered the meaning of village and it means a small group of people living together as a comunity, and i thought how will they get over 100,000 cities out of poverty.",21072_020031592.docx,"yes, the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime"" because of these examples. one, hannah sachs, the author, said that sauri was a very poor place, with lots of diseases that was untreatable for now. one of the most comon diseases was malaria. malaria can kill about 20,000 kids a night and can cause audlts to become very sick. within 4 years, the hostpital not has cures for malaria and other common diseases. that saves the many lives of sauri.	the second example is about food. farmers always plant crops but because of its not-good-soil, they only get a few crops each harvest. they barley have enough water to water their plants. with less plants, there will be less food for people. in the next 4 years, more poeple have been given enough water and fertilizer for their crops. now, starvation will barley happen it sauri. 	my last example is school. most kids in other places think that school is boring and is easy to get into. well, think again. kids in sarui don't even have enough money to pay school fees so they can't go to school. even if they did go to school, it was hard to concentrate for them because they didn't have lunch. in 4 years, even more people have helped with the school fees. there are now no more school

30 years to coplete each town. another reason why because, some people won't donate money because, they might need it for their contry! plus the might not unite with them to help africa. they might not donate because they have any money or they are selfesh people. also they won't donate because, they might hate africa or just need it for food for themselve or kids. another reason why is still

however, that took four years. things are still not going very well there. there are two mains reasons i do not agree with the author of this article. i don’t believe winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.	there may be water and electricity in hospitals at sauri, kenya. there may be more bed nets to prevent malaria. there might be schools that are free to attend. these achievements are great. however, there are many cities out there that are still in great poverty. if it took four years to help sauri, it would take many more years to help all of the other cities in the world. life in sauri is still very hard. people there need more money. winning the fight against poverty is not achievable in our lifetime. 	my first main reason that shows how winning the fight against poverty is unachievable in my lifetime is about time. the text states, “the year was 2004, the first time i had ever been to sauri.” the paragraph containing this sentence goes on to say that sauri was looking bad then. “a better life-2008,” is the title that shows there were achievements in 2008. the achievements took four years. there are many cities in the world that are still in great poverty. if it took four years to turn around every poor city in the world, i would be long dead by the time this goal was achieved.	my second main reason is that sauri, kenya is still poor. many goals may have been achieved. this is great. sauri still needs money, though. “the attendance rate is way up,” shows that there are more kids in schools. “all of them worked hard with the few supplies they had,” shows that there was few school supplies in 2004. the text shows nothing about more supplies in 2008. there are many bad facts that are still true about sauri. so, it will take more than four years to turn sauri completely around. we don’t have that kind of time. 	overall, the author did not convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. four years to turn around every poor city in the world would take a long time. i would be dead before that happened. sauri, kenya is still not completely turned around. so every city would take more than four years to turn around. all in all, that is why the fight against poverty cannot be achieved in my lifetime.",4103501Y2_100233967.docx,"the author did convince me. he did because the author wanted to

would be willing to give up their time and money for these people. the economy is bad. so the people can be stingy with their money. actually, even when the economy is better, some people might be protective of their money, after what they have gone through. now, i'm not saying, it's not possible, because it is. this projected started in 2004 and by 2008, the life of those who live in sauri was already better. in the four years, no money for medicine, lack of water & fertilizer for crops and even no lunch for students has changed to the opposite.		to me, making poverty is history...is impossible...there are so many people who are poor. sometimes, they can't help it, or just sometimes they can't find a job. it is impossible to get rid of poverty. i think society is meant to be like this, where there would be rich people an poor people. i'll consider a one-star rated restaurant a bad job. a one-star rated restaurant where barely anybody goes in and comes out. compare that to a nice four-star rated restaurant owned by a rich person and hiring fine cooks who cook fine food. if all the restaurants in the city or town would be a four-star rated restaurant, there wouldn't be a most popular one, would there? actually...i'm bad at explaining things but what i'm saying is, there has to be a winner, and a loser. which is, the rich people & middle classed people are considered ""winners"" and the people who are poor are the ""losers"". that's how society is made like. we can change some, but not all.",41272_020024130.docx,"one example from the text that convinced me was

poverty. anther example that convinced me was where the author says that the people now have fertilizer and seeds to grow/plant. that is one major advancement. when people recieve the food, they will have enough to be healthy and not starve. i believe they are going to be in good conditions. lastly, my final example is when the author says that there is no more school fee and the kids now get a

years. for example before millennium villages project happen they had to pay school fee, but now there are no school fees. another example was that they could not pay for medicine for all the most

up being poor crops. each year, they always wonder if they would be able to feed the entire family.	the millineum villages project also helped make “the schools a better place to learn. before, there

worked hard with the few supplies they had with no lunch. now, the millineum project made school with no fees. they got more supplies for school and now, they even serve lunch. because of this, the attendance rate has gone higher.	i think winning the fight against poverty is really achievable because if all these dramatic changes happened in 80 villages across the sub-saharan africa in just 4

wealthy countries such as the u.s, china, and possibly england. these countries are just examples, even though kenya is doing a lot better, we as united nations would like to keep them strong. 	one reason i think many other countries should be participating in this activity or “fund raiser” is because kenya is not wealthy. the people of kenya are just barely holding onto the little bit of what they have. so in order to have another country back on it’s feet and strong we need to contribute to giving them some nice crops and clothing. maybe even some more schools and teachers. my personal opinion to kenya’s poverty, i think it’s unexceptable because all of these states, provinces, countries and others we have around the world today, are always talking about the money they have but don’t want to share. 	thinking back to when the millennium village projects were first starting and was not worldwide. makes me wonder, how did they do it? the millennium village projects took on a big task to save a very poor country from losing all hope of normal lives of satisfaction and sucess. kenya used to be a poor country with no medicine or cures for their everyday diseases. but now look at kenya, a nice lower-middle class society they have schools for free, more crops that are actually eatable. kenya has come a long way with their poverty and depression.	kenya is now recieving

only the year 2012, she wrote down the sentence ""we are halfway to 2015, and the world is capable of meeting these goals,"" which convonced me that it would be done by 2015. the next sentence ""but our first glimpse of sauri showed us that there was plenty of work to do"", but it never said it was impossible to do.another reason, example of how the author convnced me that ""winning the fight

improved and so did the defense against malaria. if they could do that in 4 years, what could they do in 11 years total? so thats my second reason/example.the last example or reason (no time) of how

economy & trades. if it isn’t adequate or well decent enough, then we can’t end poverty if the country isn’t improving enough of adequately or decent wealth, food, supplies, & minerals. if we need to bring an end to poverty, we should take drastic steps & dramatic countermeasure, also included measures & more materials in the global economy. the people must work as one to ended hunger, school

have to bite people and make them sick.	in 2004 sauri wasn't doing good at all. the hospital was very small and their was no electricity, running water, and it was ran by a clinical officer. malaria killed 20,000 kids each day and made adults very qick. they can buy a bed ned for only $5 but people was so poor there, they could not afford it and later on get sick. some people in sauri would be farmers but a lot of their crops would die because they dont have fertilizer, and if the farmers dont have food for their family the family would be hungry and their children would be very sick from starvation.	most people in american don't have to go through this, but other people in cities, states, or even countries around the would has to go through poverty and other people around the world

hte goals are realistic and some will only appear in your dreams.  some people’s goal is to just simply bringing water to those people that need it, or avoiding proverty.i alot of the villages people are really poor.  they can’t afford to hire doctors, lunch, and electricity to the places that need it.  i think there is a possibility that by the time i die the world can end proverty.  like in the passage, it took the millennium villager project to get one village to have all the things they need.  and that also makes me think we can’t end proverty because there are alot of people who are poor like sauri, it only took them 4 years but other villages will take longer time.there are pros and cons of ending poverty.  once people get wealthier than before they wil have to pay more taxes.  that is the con.  the pro about ending poverty is that everyone can get healthy and education, and that everyone will get the knowledge as the kids like us.so, i still don’t really think that poverty will end by the time i die.  it’s really hard to end proverty.  if you say could proverty end in some countries i will say yes.  but now it’s the world.  the world is big and the world has alot of poor people.  but...you will never know.  miracles happens and the world might end proverty.  when hannah went to sauri the place was horrible, but when she went 4 years later it got better.  it had better things on everything.if people doesn’t die so fast, then the world will get better.  people can find out ways to end proverty or we can use the old fashion way.  the old fashion way is the way in the

convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our outline because even poverty is in many places, it still is acheivable in many ways.      my first example is in sauri, kenya in africa. they started off with having nothing but the millennium villages project gave them things they did not have as first such as food, good shelter and fertilizer and clothing. then after a while they started to get all of the supplies they needed.      my next example is also many places in africa have no clean water so they get very sick. slowly, organizations are bringing clean water to african villages.      i also believe that it is hard to win the fight against poverty. a reason i think this, is because poverty exists all around the world in different cases. it will be hard to end all of this, but it is still possible.      this is why i believe winning the fight against poverty is possible.",21341_020028593.docx,"i believe that we can't fight poverty. i know it's kind of mean, but do you realize how many other countries are in poverty too? well that's why with the technology we have today we can move to areas so we can start over. the richer areas are usually like that because they worked extremely hard to build their nations. if other are as are poor it usually means that their representative/leader didn't work hard enough to help them. so why should we, we hardly not them. (no offense)	well there's a difference in being broke and going through hard times. if a natural disasters happened then of course your probably struggling and other countries should help then we would. now you said kids are dying because of mosquitos. what you do is you find a way to fight it. i know that you're provably thinking that ""ohh we don't have any money, what can we do""? well you do what we do in the old days, we barter/trade. every area has something that they have plenty of. so you find other areas who want that and will give you the stuff you need. it's a simple strategy. you should always give something back to a person who gave you something so when you trade you're helping yourself and others. so why give if you don't get anything back.	now you also said that you were worried about farming, water, and food. well all you have to do is work out a plan. not come crawling to other countries for the money that they worked hard to earn. all you have to do is think about what you need and what you have. so if you need fertilizer you can make your own, or maybe go to another place and try to barter off whatever you have. water is probably the easiest thing to get i don't even know why you're even asking for it. just go to a body of fresh water and drink. not all kids have to go to school. you can make more schools with a smaller amount of kids so you only have to barter off a little bit of stuff off.	when you life in an area that is plentiful of something you begin to get known for that you have. in 1849 there was a gold rush in california and people started to come over and try to strike it rich. then we started to trade gold for other natural resources including oil, water and vegetation so why (for example) would california go over to nevada and say ohh give us some money, we're going to die without it, then nevada dies, so make sure that you should barter, now kill one another and take away hard-earned money.",21061_020031157.docx,"this

anyone could help end poverty, but it can’t be easy doing it. she convinced me because her story made me think that the millennium villages project could help the people in sauri, kenya end poverty. their plan was to get people out of poverty , assure them better health care, and build a better quality of life. what happened before the millennium villages project (m.v.p) helped the people in sauri, kenya, which was in 2004 was that the hospitals in sauri were not in good shape. the patients were everywhere ,and could not get treated, which could get them killed. there was no running water or electricity, so no one could see in the hospital. the patients also had many diseases, but the most common one in kenya is called malaria. malaria is a disease that is carried by mosquitos that can be treated and prevented. kids can die by it with only one bite,and it can get adults really sick. one way to treat it is by bed nets. everyday, 20,000 kids die from the disease each day, but since they don’t have bednets, most of all the people will die. another problem in sauri is that farms have dying crops because they can’t afford the fertilizer and irrigation. the farmers worry that their children won’t get enough food to eat, which can make them hungry and sick. another problem in sauri is that many kids can’t afford to get to school because their parents can’t afford it. the students wanted to learn but they had a limited ammount of school supplies. also, the kids can’t eat a mid-day meal, so the children didn’t have any energy. but after four years, the millennium villages project (m.v.p) made their lives better in 2008. they have medicine in the hospitals, which was free of charge, for all of the most diseases in kenya. there is water and electricity in the hospitals. bed nets were in every sleeping site in sauri. hunger was addressed with the proper needs and tools for farming. school is free, and lunch is served in schools. but there is a problem, since the water irrigation is used in lakes, the lake will eventually start to dry up, and the fishermen will not be able to catch any fish, which there will no longer be if there is no water. the millennium villages

millenium village progect had started. but not everything is free, they have energy and water, and medicine to the most common diseases. another example sachs states ""kids die from it (malaria) and aduts get very sick."" this means that although there is treatment for maleria, so many people were dying from it. in 2008, bed nets were in every single sleeping facility. this means that all there hard work payed off.	sauri now has better farming facilities. for example. sachs states that ""their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fartilizers and irrigation."" farmers would always think if they would have enough food and if their kids would go hungry and get sick. now, they have fertilizer and seeds, and tools they needed. example, sachs states ""time and again, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because lack of fertilizer and water."" many people were hungry and getting sick because many supplies was not there. now they have enough food to get by. this means it has worked.	sauri's education has also increased over the years. for example, sachs states ""many kids in sauri did not attend school because there parent could not afford school fees."" kids could not go to school and there future would not be bright. now school there is 100% free. also, sachs states ""it was hard for them to concentrate, though, as

running around in bare feet and tattered clothing. this means that kids need better clothing.in sauri people lived in less than $1 a day. this means that people in kenya barely make $1. there should be electricity and water in the hospital. there should also be more medicine in the hospital because people are dying. people are dying because of malari. malari is one disease, common in africa, that is preventable and treatable. more than 20,000 kids die from malari each day. mosquitoes that carry malari come at night. you can get a bed net to prevent these insects.a bed net has chemicals that last for 5 years for $5. bed nets kill the insects’ that come towards people. in 2004 schools did not have enough books, paper, and pencils. there was also no mid-day meal which made kids out of energy. most kids had to share books with 3-4 people.many people did not have the money to pay school fees. some people did not have money for fertilizer to put on the crops. in 2008 many things changed. the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free charge, for almot all diseases. water is connected to the hospital, which also has a genarator for electricity. bed nets are used in every

that the school now serve lunch to children that go to school so that they could have energy for the day. another example that convinced me was with the hospitals. first there were no medicines and few beds for patients. but in 2008 kenya got medicines and more beds for the hospitals and has running water and a generator for electricity. the last example that convinced me was with the farmers and crops. in 2008 kenya abtained fertelizer and seeds to go crops for food so that starvation would no occur there examples convinced me that kenya is improving.,31361_020028753.docx,"i think her story was convincing that winning for fighting poverty is achievable during our lifetime because we already made an improvement in 4 years. a lot has changed while the 4 years of the act has started.

millennium villages project. there are many soulutions to the problems that keep people improvished.” if there were many solutions back then, we could have more and more solutions.	i also believe we can achieve what they fought for since 2004, about the millennium villages project because it says, “the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all the common diseases.” if that was accomplished, i believe we can win because in the beginning they wanted to fight for a better health. they have accomplished that and they’re still working on it.	i want them to win the fight against poverty because i don’t want anyone to have to die because they couldn’t pay for a health plan. it’s sad to hear that children in the hospital have to share beds because there is no space. it’d be sad to hear someone died because a hospital didn’t have the medication or supplies needed to help them. there should be more people helping out in a hospital, especially a doctor which clearly says in “the fight for better health” that they had a clinical person not a doctor at all.",2127501Y2_100220748.docx,"obviosly, yes. defeating poverty is achievable throughout our lifetime. the millennium village program is working really hard to end poverty, and give all people a better living quality. on the hospital they did noticable changes. they program gave the hospital which for mally has no doctors and medicines doctors and medicines. they gave free supplies like medicines and bednets to poor people. but sicknesses like malaria that can be preventable are being caught. and is left untreated because of poverty. fertilizers, seeds, and irrigation are supposed to be in a farmer’s property anytime. even these basic things aren’t present, causing people to die of starvation. basic education is also missing. school supplies and meals arent given to poor students. most importantly, there is no food. the most basic need is missing, causing weak sicknesses to easily enter weak people with little resistance, causing them to die. these things are changed by m.v.p. the m.v.p. lessen problems, but not took them completely off. hospitals are better with doctors and medicines. malaria is being treated better and being prevented. fertilizer, seeds, and water is being provided. schools are free, and offer free supplies and food. despite of all these efforts to end poverty, there are many problems.the first problem is money.many expensive things are being given for free, but who pays for all of this. if this will be paid by taxpayers, how will they buy their basic needs. instead of doing those things at the top first, how come they can’t give people better jobs or higher salaries. why couldn’t they bring factories to boost economies, give better salaries, and give more jobs. the second problem is corruption. how are the low class people going to benefit if their higher officials and leaders are taking their money. one of the first things that mvp should assure is if they have honest officials and not corrupt officials. i lived in the philippines so i understand that one of the main causes of poverty are corrupt officials and low economies. the third problem is food. without foods, how are people going to avoid being sick and absent. people should have access to cheap healthy foods. people should also have better family planning. to avoid splitting small salaries into house, electricity, water and food for 5-14 people family” bills. the next big problem is irrigation (see illus. on the left.). if people have irrigation channels for farms, it’s good, but where is the water coming from? lakes with freshwater that fishermen rely for money and food. they catch fish from lakes, but what if there are no lakes. people are building hydroelectric dams for free electricity, but what if the lakes and rivers dry up. both fishermen and farmers will have nothing to get money from. there will also be less jobs because if no foods are caught or farmed, what will people who sell and transport them do. what if many more people cause global warming. more lakes and rivers will dry up faster and faster. if a family gets what they want, how about the other family who is affected by the taking needs for the other family? will they be happy? despite all these problems, i conclude that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.”",3108501Y1_000487573.docx,"it is important for kids around the united to know that life in kenya was hard. we need to know this because we need to see that we are actually a very

""kids can die from it (malaria easaly, and adults can get very sick"" (1). she shows here how life was before the millenium cillages act was put in place. life their was full of desise. that was in

district has medicine and it was free, also they had running water",21172_020060688.docx,"guenza_020060688yes, the author did convince me. one example of why i agree with the author is because she mentioned a hospital with many people who were sick and had diseases. but, then throughout the years the hospital eventually had free medical care, and working electricity and water. another reason why i agree is because when the project first started the farmers couldn’t afford fertilizer, they couldn’t grow crops because they had no water, and like the hospital, it got better.  the farmers could finally afford fertilizer for their crops and there was enough water to go around which led to people not starving anymore. another example of why i agree is the school crisis. when the project started and even before that the kids parents had to pay fees for their child or children to go to school. they also barely had any supplies, and the schools did not mid-day meals. even through all of that, the schools finally got enough supplies, the schools did not have any more fees, and they started to serve mid-day meals. this leads to better test scores, kids getting a better education and also a healthier school. the last example is that after all that, people finally had enough money so that they could buy things such as; bed nets, to keep the mosquitoes away which kept away malaria, and other things such as food and water. after all that the author did convince me that we can beat poverty. as hard as it can be and how everlong it takes we can win the fight against

poverty is achieveable in our lifetime.  as the last paragraph said, sauri has already start to shown improvement and if we, the people put our heads together and truly want to help countries that are fighting against poverty, we can make a change. 	going back on the topic of sauri the changes after the four years was huge! the 2004 hospital with patients that couldn’t afford or didnt have treatment back then has changed! they now have medicine, that’s free of charge, and they have it for all of the most common dieseases! the problem with no running water and electricity has also been fixed with water connected to the hospital and a generator for electricity. bed nets are also avaible in every sleeping site in sauri with also decreases the amount of people getting sick and needing medicine. that’s only a part of the change that has been made also!	next is the hunger crisis. back then: poor outcomes of crops, lack of fertilizer and water, farmers worrying if they’ll have enough food for their family. after the four years, boom!, a huge change, people are given now with fertilizers and seeds and also tools to maintain the food supply. that also means less sick people in ways!	my last topic education, back then school wasn’t availible for most kids since the fees were too expensive and/or they had to help their family with chores. even people who could go to school had little supplies which weigh them down from learning even if they wanted to. addition of another food problem of kids getting tired from lack of the midday meal. once again, a huge change has been made! there are no longer school fees and the school now serves lunch! thanks to that the attendance rate of kids getting education is going up also!	this is why i believe that winning the fight against poverty is possible. in a minimum of 4 years such big changes were already made in sauri, so why not other places? we can win. we can if we try. if we dont many places will be be ruined. families lots of things. yes, we can!",4132501Y3_100253738.docx,"yes, because in just four years they acomplished many things. for example, the hospitals didn’t had medicine, electricity and good

because it was free. they also got supplies, and books. they also started to give lunch at school, and that caused kids to go to school everyday. now the kids can discover new things at school. the last example, they gave everything they needed to the farmers. they gave fertilizer, seeds, and tools. they also got some water to everyone. i think that the author did a great job because he showed

the hospital is giveing the medicines alway for fee so i am wondering how they are makeing money. also how are they going to pay for medicines and school supplies another example of why not is how they going to pay the electricity bill to keep the generator going in the hospital if no one is pay for the things they need. another example is that there is 80 other villages with the millennium village project going on but like i said before how the going to keep the fight against poverty going if no one is paying for anything or if no one got any jobs to pay for any thing they need to keep there family safe from danger. am also wondering how are they going to pay for other villages around the world if there spending so much money on one place. they me guess there going to take more money from my mom and other people that have to pay bills.,2106691Y2_100260887.docx,"yes the story has convinced me that winning the fight against proverty is achievable, because people need good

needs a better school and education inorder to become smart and get a job. without a job a person wouldn't be able to make money and without money people wouldn't be able to buy homes to live in.	we need hospitals so that we don't become sick because of lak of medicine. people could die without the right treatment.	we need food in order to grow and stay healthy. we also need water so that we

fertilizer, seeds, and farming tools to help their hunger crisis. plus, we got them to go to school without any school fees and they also have lunches now!	eventhough it takes time, we got enough of it to spare. if we managed to do all that for them, who knows how much we can accomplish in the future! we just all need to let everyone knows so we can get more donations to help the rest of the people. we can get volunteers to help out and give the people our ears to hear what they have in mind to help. having maybe youtube celebs know the problem and they could help get the word out! there are millions of people out there that would support the project, but they just need to know it's there. there are hundreds of ways to let people know about the project, we just need the motivation to show it to people. but everything doesn't always happen that easy and fast, but in the end, everything would have been a great accomplishment.",2127501Y3_000503408.docx,"yes it was an achievable goal in our lifetime. before sauri, kenya achieved thier goal they were going through some rough times. for example kenya didn't have no beds, no drs, no water, no electricity, and mosquitoes with malaria. and barely had food because they did'nt have irragation and fertlillizer so the farmers had a problem and it was that the farmers were afraid that they did'nt have enough and they were worried that thier childern might get sick from staration. now the childern can't go to school because thier parents can't afford it, some are needed for chores, such as fetching water and wood, and in 2004 hte schools minimal of schools supplies such as paper, books, and many move, but the childern still wanted to go to school with the little they had for supplies. now the people in sauri had a amazing progress in just four years. the yala sub-district hospital had gave sauri medicine for free of charge for the most common disease they have. water is connected to the hopsital, which had a generator

chemical that can stop the mosquitos from giving he people malaria. the other problem in 2004 was water, fertilizer, and knowledge she said ""the crop were dying because of no fertilizer and they coulding afford it and water to make them grow. families plant crop just for them to die without fertilizer and water the other problem was the schools like many kid did not attend school because their parents dont have money to pay their school fees (because of the poverty that they are going through they cant even get food to eat because of poverty) like i was saying so the kid stay home and help with chores and fetch water and wood, the schools have no supplies like books, paper or pencil but the kid really want to learn but it is hard for them to consentrate because of no food to eat and they have no energy left in them. but then in 2008 every thing got better and look the hospitals have medicine and water and people dont have to pay for all most common diseases, they have bed nets in all the places, there is no more hunger because of the fertilizers and seeds provided for them, there is no more school fees and lunch is always served so the author really convinced me that

fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. yes, i personally think that our generation could win the war against poverty. in sauri, kenya everything isn’t in its best state. crops don’t grown successfully because they cant afford fertilizer. plants need four things to grow, which is soil, sunlight, oxygen, and water. in sauri, there isn’t a lot of water and the water supply they have is mostly dirty. plants don’t need fresh, clean water to grow but water is a need for plants and with a low supply this is another reason farming isn’t successful. now school is a whole other issue. to go to a school in sauri you have to pay school fees, which were to expensive for some families so most children weren’t learning they were doing chores at home. school fees weren’t the only knowledge related issue, it was also that there wasn’t a midday meal (lunch) the children couldn’t gain energy from the food because they couldn’t eat so they couldn’t concentrate on the work. in 2008 we have seen dramatic changes. sauri has made amazing progress thanks to the millennium villages project and its supporters now it’s the year 2011 and sauri, kenya and other villages have made great progress.",2109591Y2_000557740.docx,"yes i believe that winning the fight against poverty in our lifetime is not achievable because areas are advancing. in 2004 sauri kenya was extremely poor. 4 years later 80 villages sub saharan africa has change dramatically. they can afford food, water, and supplies. encouraging people in the minellium village project and other societys we can end poverty in our world. the plan is to get people out of poverty, assure them ascess to health care. the marketing, and economy is terrible without money in todays society. everywhere you have to give something to get. poverty is affecting our world, causing war and lobbey, if we can work as a team i believe we can stop poverty. the yala district hospital for example (in 2004) had rooms packed with patients. no running water or electricity patients cannot afford things, if you hate this, then lets change.",21221_020054903.docx,"yes i agree because, if “winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime”. also if we can stop proverty in the sauri, kenya we can stop poverty in a lot of other places to. but if we don’t’ help those people sooner more and more people are going to get disease that are treatable but they don’t have the things that we have there and they can get very sick or worse die. so i think that we should help places out by giving them school things like books, pencil, and parer. the sauri life is hard a day they got payed less than $1.00 dollar and at the end of the month they have less than 31 dollars. 	so if we help them out we can help them with there learning, poverty, and with the hospitals. but if we don’t help them out they will not have a good life or education. so i believe that if we help them out with poverty they won’t be starving and won’t have the clothes that we have or shoes. we could send them shoes or clothes or book paper, pencils, pens, markers. that is why i agree with the girl that wrote this. p.s. i liked how she

the millenium village project they could afford medicine and school is free also that school provides lunch.,11432_020014138.docx,"is it true?i believe that after reading this article i am convinced that the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime in the sub-saharan africa.i came to this conclusion because hannah sachs gave multiple great examples of what work they have achieved in the four years between 2004-2008. for example sachs states that a hospital called the yala sub-district hospital has already initiated a program that has medicine. the best part is that the medicine is free of charge.another thing that seems promising is that bed nets are already being used in all sleeping locations in sauri. this is good because the more sleeping/bed nets there are the less desises there will be. the result of this is that the hospitals will be less ocupied wich will alow other patients that have other problems to actually be attended to.another critical thing is that the hunger crisis is being handled. there are fertilizers being passed out so the vegtebles and fruits will grow stronger. there is also seeds being distributed so that impovreshed comunities can get their own food. once the crops start to go well it will alow more kids to go to school, which are now being free of charge. it will also allow the kids at school to bring a lunch so that they won’t lost their energy in the middle of the day, causing them to be discouraged, and distracted, from their school work and class.due to these reasons i think that we will have resolved the poverty crisis im my generation. the fact that we did all the things above in only 4 years means that we will definitly resolve the poverty crisis in at least the sub-saharan africa may in other places hopefully too.",4112591Y2_100216476.docx,"yes the author did convince me that winning a fight against poverty is achievable in this liftime, but i also know that sometimes it takes more than

poor, hungry, and sick.  they lacked the supplies they needed.  then four years later, they got those supplies.  if it is possible in sauri, it could be possible everywhere else.  in the article, the millenium villages project helped about 80 sub-saharan africa villages.  it took a lot of time but they got it done.  it is like taking one step at a time.  that is why the quote is “in our lifetime”.  a lifetime is a very long time and i agree that it will take that long.  in the article, it stated that the people in sauri cannot afford to buy bed nets to prevent malarial mosquitoes from infecting them.  because of this 20,000 kids die each day.  it took four years to get all of them bed nets and mosquite repelents.  four years is a long time, and there are many villages in need, like the author said.  the people in sauri did not have education for a long time.  it also took the project a long time to give them education.  that is why i think that poverty can be solved, but it will

millenium villages project, the fight against poverty in sauri, kenya was achieved. i know it was achieved because huge improvements were made in sauri. these improvements include no school fees, hunger crisis has been addressed, & the tools have been found to maintain a good food supply. all of these improvements have made huge impacts on sauri.	no school fees, have let children go to school, get a good education, without having to pay for. this helps the parents of the children because the amount of money a family lives on is already very low, if there were school fees, the families would be in a dier emergency. the family would not be able to buy enough food, buy good medicines & most importantantly, would not be able to keep the family strong, & bonding together. not having school fees, definiately helps children get a good education & keeps a family strong. not having school feel is something i believe can help all the families in sauri.	the hunger crisis being addresed, has helped many people in multiple ways. when the hunger crisis was not addressed, people would starve to death. family members & friends were lost by starvation each & every day. the millennium villages project in sauri, kenya helped many people overcome their hunger crisis. food in the stomachs of many people in sauri, kenya made a huge difference.the items being found to maintain a good food supply helped people in sauri, kenya have a meal daily. a person could look forward to a meal at least once a day instead of once a month. this has helped the food crisis become addressed. thanks to the millennium villages project, the food crisis has been addressed & will hopefully never happen again. the millennium villages project, helped many people in kenya in multiple

mosquitoes. so even though they do not have many supplies now they can have some throughout time. many people have been giving back to africa. for example people like oprah and american idol. the little girl has made me think that everyone can help with the millennium villages. the fight against poverty can be won throughout our lifetime. to win the fight we have to give fertilizer so they can

bed and 2 adults to a bed. and they don’t even have the right treatment to prevent the diseases, so some people died and didn’t have too. another example is in paragraph 10 when the author states that

be easily treated but people didn’t have the money. families are dying to because they have no fertilization for their crops. plus people needed irrigation for their crops. 	finally the mellenium villages project came to kenya. the hospital now has medicine free of charge. water is now connected to the hospital. a generator was also installed for electricity. there are no more school fees and

patients. another example is the bed nettings that the people of sauri ahve but not all of them. so they can easily get malaria from mosquitos because those people might have not bed nets which can mean life or death for them. then in 2008 every sleeping site on sauri has bed nets and mostly malaria free. the last example about the poverty in sauri is the schools and hunger of sauri. the schools ddn’t have food, and also we’re not free because of poverty. also hunger struck because families cannot make food because they didn’t have that much crops and not that much money.",3122691Y3_100208914.docx,"“winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime”, because with all of the new technology and new programs for medical help; fighting against poverty in any part of the world in not only possible but it is obtainable in every way. that’s because we now have many programs that fight against poverty & prevent it. for example: the millennium village project, the goodwill organization, & many more. anyway, as it said in the article, “the schools had minimal supplies like books, pencils, &paper,” organizations could get supplies, lunches, books, and most imp. students for the schools. so, that learning could exist in the schools. there could be a small organization that can only work on persuading children to attend schools. for example: they could make flyers, posters, and advertisments for this purpose. in the article, it said that, “the yala hospital was not in good shape at all” here’s what we could do: we could get medical insurance for people, help hospitals maintain medicine, and help the hospitals recieve vacinations. the organizations & programs could recieve money from donations and local “pitch in’s.”",2123501Y1_000490606.docx,"the author thinks it’s important because we have all the supplies we need but sauri, kenya has almost nothing. for example, the misquitoes have malairia in sauri,

electricity and the families can’t pay for treatment. the farmers also have crops that are dying and can’t feed their family. the auther is telling how if we all give the millennium villages some of what we have it can make a big difference.",2109591Y3_000514548.docx,"yes, the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. the reason i say yes is because in the text it said that when the child went to kenya in 2004 there was no water or electricity in the hospital. the text also said that most kids did not go to school because there parents could not afford it. the text also said that most famers crops were dying because there was not enough water and fertilizer to help the crops grow. the reason i'm really convinced is because in 2004 life was hared for them but as soon as 2008 came everything changed. in 2008 there was water and electricity in the hospital. the had doctors and better medicines. also in 2008 the kids were able to go to school because there were no school fees. the farmers were able to get the tools and fertilizers that they need. i infer that in 4 years if a community works together they could make a big change. i also think that teamwork can get the job done.",41262_020060681.docx,"my answer is a yes. we can always try out best to help save the world free of poverty. it is our job to try and help everybody, because we are one and a whole. it is up to everyone to help and participate.if we try and help, we needs lots and lots and lots and lots of money. and the only way we can get those money is to ask company owners for help. but if they refuse, maybe we can put in some of our weekly money given by parents. adults can be a bigger part in this, without them, i don’t think we can actually do anything. and with this issue in our hands, it’s up to us to convince everyone about this problem. the examples i have support my answers are dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. the progress in encouraging to supporters of the millennium villages project. second example is what it will really take is is for the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good. the third example is the people of sauri have made amazing progress in just four years. the fourth example is the yala-sub district hospital has medicine, free of

like this it would be super easy to reach that goal. also if a lot of people help with like food, water, school supplies, medical treatment, and clothes they would end poverty pretty soon. but it takes time.	if we start with even the littlest things everyday, like donating clothes or things like that it would be great. like how in 4 years they already helped a lot. they got water, lights, and medicine for their hospitals. they got free school and lunch. they got paper, pencils, and other school supplies. each bet got mosquito nets, which saved a lot of lives, since before that 20,000 kids died each day from malaria. all this happened in just 4 years.	the sad thing though is, that now a days, there are barely peope who help out for thigs like this, when here were we live we get to have schools, free luch, the goverment helps a lot of people, food-stamps, wellfare, shild support, and the list goes on. which in other places like africa they don't have that. and a lot of people take advantage of that here, where in other places people really need it.	so, we could stop poverty but people need to cooperate and help, it will take time but if more people help it would be done sooner, and then they can reach there goals sooner and help even more places. so if things go that way poverty can be ended, but it will take support, cooperation, patience and

one year everything takes a grogress. in the subsection a better life - 2008, it really convinced me that winning the fight against poverty can be achieved. for an example, four years after hannah visited sarui, kenya they got medicine and it is free of charge. another thing that was impoved since 2004 was that the hospitals have water connected to them. the water also generates electricity. also one thing that sauri, kenya go were bed nets to protect people while their sleeping from getting malaria (which comes from mosquitoes) or protecting people from even dying from the disease malaria. another thing that was improved was the hunger crisis. that was solved by sauri getting seeds and fertilizer so that food could now be grown. also there are now no school fees so it would be easier for children to come to school. since there are no school fees and sauri now has food the attendance rate is up from the food so they can be in school. also the children can be in school because they have water and they don't have to go get it themselves. and i think since sauri now has medicine for the common disease the hospitals don't have to put three people to a bed or put two

""the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply,"" is what sachs told. one more thing that convinced me is the attendence rate for school. ""many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford school fees,"" is what happened in 2004. however, in 2008, school fees did not exist and many children went to school.

war, they probably thought of it that way because they are poor and struggling. their goal is achievable because they already improved in 2008. so if they keep striving like in 2008, as said in the

mosquitoes away, they aren’t that expensive too. with water and fertilizer, they can get good food by themselves easily now so people won’t die from starvation as much. schools will help kids learn to

people won't starve for hunger because their fertilizer are really bad. people can have healthier body and not just a bony body. some people say its a waste of money. but it is nice to help people and

malaria from the mosquitto. 20,000 kids are dieing a day because of malaria. if we contribute just $5 then people can get bed nets. some people might say waste of money. $5 is less than people's death. people live with $1 a day so help them. people are people and they deserve to lives just like us.	some people may say that, ""why should we waste all our money on them"". first of all they're

a bed, and two adults to a bed. personly i think that all children, and adults should have their own bed, because they all came in the hospital for a reason, they have an illness that can spread, and

atomaticly have a infection well known as a disease and the cause of it is that children, and adults can die easily from the infection. i think that bad suari primary school shouldn't have to suffer.

because even though the people in sauri had nothing, they still were ably to get a better school, agriculture, and medication. so far from 2004 - now, 80 villages have been cured from poverty. the 4 main problems that every village in africa has is economy, farming, schools, and medication. each one of these needed money, for their economy to improve. all the villagers were paid no more that a $1 a day. this this leads to the villages' agriculture. since they don't have enough money, they can't buy the proper type of fertilizer for their crops. no matter how many times they plant new seeds, it just keeps on dying. if they had a better economy, then they would have enough momey to buy the right kind of fertilizer. due to the problem with farming, and the economy, it injures the schools like a chain reaction. since the parents don't have enough money, they can't send their child to school. while the kids that can afford school, can't event get lunch due to the farming and economy. which finally leads to kids and adults getting sick. the hospitals has tiny rooms and sick children are all bunched together on one bed. all the children become sick because either they don't have enough food or because of how their economy is and they can't even afford enough clothes to keep them warm. though on the other hand over the past 4 years or so, sauri has improved in progress tremendously. now the hospitals have water and electricity. while the kids and adults get medicine for diseas like malaria for free. they used to not be able to afford ned nets which cost $5. now there is a bed net in every possible sleeping area. the agriculture used to be horrible. now they were given the proper tools, fertilizer, and seeds to grow crops for their villages. thus which leads all to school. there used to be a cost for school, now there is no school fee. they used to not have lunch, now school serves lunches for the kids. so then there are more kids that want to go to school an the attendance rate increases. all they needed was help from people that are actually dedicated on this project. the only thing they need is time, money, and help. i believe that after a certain amount of

of all no doctor!! that shows me that we/they can better! in paragraph 6-7 the article tells me about a disease called malaria (man-lair-eeh-ah), “that “malaria is carried by mosquito’s and they

can donate things to that village. also send like hospital things. for example, the hospitals did not have electricity and no medicenes before the millenium village project. today the sauri has a

known that that many kids have died from that one diease and i also think it’s good because after fighting against poverty many more kids were able to go to school the first reason why they wasn’t able to go to school was because school did not supple mid day food for the kids so i think that the parents didnt want to send the kdis to school because there was’nt any food for thema nother eason why it was also good was because they got medicine for the people who need it. one type of nedicne that theyneeded was for malaria because malrai is a diease passed on by a mosquitoe that can kill kids easly and faster than adults. adults will get very sick. the most import recison why i think that it’s good for the winning fighting for provety is that farmers got the fertillizer they need to plant their crops. so without winning the war of proverty non of these wonderful things will be given to the people to help them survive in the harsh lands of africa also without it many people would have died instead of being 20,000 kids it problay would have been way more about 40,0000 kids dead because their parnets couldnt afford the nets to keep the mosquitoes away from them and their kids

make homes. that would help and then kenya would be improved, in fact kenya is not the only contry in africa that has poverty in fact i think all of africa has poverty and needs help. i know 1000 kids die from malaria each day in africa. africa is not the healthiest continent in the world. it is a tragedy about what has been happening to africa, earthquakes, floods, and many more natural disasters.

to do something about it. the hospitals had no running water and electricity. one of the most common diseases, was malaria which was caused by misquitos. people couldn’t even afford a $5 net because they were living off a $1 each day. many people were on the verge of death, until the project raised enough money to supply the hospitals with medicine, water, and electricity without charge to the people.	this project was also able to provide a better education. since many people were in poverty, they couldn’t afford to go to school to get an education. so instead they stayed at home performing chores such as getting water and food. this project encouraged kids to go to school, which they didnt need to pay for anymore. the school now serves lunch which will help the studensts focus more and get a better education.	many of the villagers didnt have enough food the feed their families, because they were very poor. their crops were dying because they didnt have water systems

gonna have that item. you can’t get the item when you are fighting for it. try convicing them that you want that item. when they say no, you cannot just fight for it. you have to try convincing another people. if they want some of your item then make a deal. if you try to make a deal with that person and that person just denied it you have to try making a deal with somebody else then. making a deal with somebody is not that difficult. if you try to make a deal with somebody and they denied it and you are trying to take that item from them of course you will not deserve that item. try talking to them. talking to them is a good way to start. if they don’t want you to talk to his/her then try asking somebody else. making a deal is much better than making a fight. making a fight is so

money so they can provide things for their family. its not easy at all to get lots and lots of money. we only get a little bit at a time so we can buy what we need. fighting poverty is possible. all you just have to do is work hard and do your job to get the money. sometimes people just don’t do their work and go broke or they just live in a place where they have little money like africa in 2004 in the story i have read. years a go sauri, kenya they bearly had any thing at all. they had to pay money to go to school, they had a bad hospital with no medicine and a few people to a bed and not enough to feed your family or not enough for you to eat. now they can go to school for free and they have supplies and lunch, have a good running hospital and have enough food as well. before they also got bitten by mosquitoes and maybe died but now they have nets to cover them, protect them, and they also last for five years so they can stay protected from them and not get sick from malaria at all! if a whole village and some others can be better too then you can fight the poverty as well. it went from bad to good in just four years and now it is still up and running for a long time. all they did to achive this was to raise money and work hard to make this all happen and to make it possible so they can all have a better future. we can do it too if we save money and work hard to fight our poverty in the united states. there are lots of homeless and jobless people in the united states and they can fight poverty if they just work hard and save their money to get some very good things in the future. most people don’t have some sort of job or a little bit of money because of minimum wage. these days it is pretty hard to find a job at all because there is so little jobs these days. people can’t live on minimum wage forever at all. its hard enough because there might be alot of people in one family and not enought money so they might go hungry and not have the supplies that they need to live. every one can do better and fight poverty just because they work hard and save/donate money to others so they can get the nessicary things that they need to live and be happy. this is

more villages in need of help. so many countries need to chip in to help the villages. i also think that the author provided a convincing argument, because she said the the was to be met by 2015 which is 3 years from now. this also means other countries can help to meet this time line.      the author included lots of information on how sauri is doing. like she wrote that people of sauri have made progress in just four years with the help of the millenium villages project. this project was created to get people out of poverty, assure them access to health care, and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. before people in sauri get sick and get malaria. when the author came to the hospital saw three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. they has no medical supplies and the patient could just not aford it. it was horrible.      like i said four years late sauri progress has improved. the hospitals in sauri have running water, generated electricity, and medicine free of charge. it has gotten better, but there are about 80 villages that still need help including my country where i came from, nigeria. my family is planning to help them. so the author was right. ""winning the fight againts poverty is achievable in our lifetime.",2129501Y2_000507942.docx,the author did convince me that the fight against proverty is achievable because they sufferd to get this. most people did not go to school because of the fees. also people suffer in hospitals with on medicen no bed net. also they were no fertalizer for farmer and water. they also whent to the yala sub

if we help other people like get a job, water, food, shelter, and new cloth. but if we are poverty we can work hard and work to get more money but like saving it. other way is we can do chairty to

can even give them chairs and clock, tv, paper towl and books. but if they can not read or speak english or another language. and we can make them food like cookies, pizza, chicken. some other kind of food. we can even give them paper and sisser or something so they can make on thing they wont with it. we can take some work play and have lunch with them. we can buy some things and what they lean from school and if they got it right they get a pize. oh we can give them homework to see if they get it right or wrong but it is ok for them so now they have food, money, cloth, everything they need so they are not poverty nomore.",1112501Y3_000529121.docx,"the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". i think that it is achievable because the author talks about how big the difference there was in 2004 to 2008. that is only 4 years and so much was achieved in that time. personally i thought that it would take much longer just for a little task to be achieved. when i read how much was achieved in 4 years i thought that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" all we need is for the whole world to work together.another way the author did convince me is the way she described the conditions in sauri. the author is only a 12 year old and she discribed the condition  wonderfuly. i think if a well know author who is very well worded wrote this it would of been much more discribeted. when people realize how well worded this 12 year old and they compare it to an older author they realize there is more. the conditions that the 12 year old discribed isn't at all detailed as it actual is over there. people realize how bad they have it over there and begin to compare it to their own life.one last way the author did convince me is that when you put my other two reasons together you get one big reason. it is possible to achieve the fight against poverty because people in today society care. the author has shown me what difference has been made in the little time. we can achieve this fight because we care, we try to relate our life to theirs' and we can't. we think about how spoiled we look compared to them. if the whole world has that thought in mind we can win this fight against poverty one step at a time, together as a team.",1106591Y2_000514494.docx,"yes, the author convinced me that “ winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime” i’m convinced because she talks about how africa defeated poverty. in the text it says that in 2004 when she first visited kenya, the hospitals weren’t in good shape. the author said the hospital didn’t have electricity, water, or doctors there just a clinical officer. at the hospital there were untreated patients that were probably close to death. the author also stated most kids in sauri didn’t attend schools because their parents couldn’t afford it. in the text it says that the schools didn’t give kids lunch and didn’t have many supplies. with the help of the milenniun villages project, in 2008, the sauri people have made amazing progess. the hospitalhas medicine, free of charge, for the most common diseases. there are no school fees, and schools now serve lunch. bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. also, the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds as well as tools to maintain the food supply. also, the school attendance rate went up since there are no school fees. since all of that happened i was convinced poverty could be defeated.",4112601Y2_000485915.docx,"yes it is possible. if we all work together. poverty can be beat.my first reason is in just four years sauri turned from a horrible town to nice, healthy town. if you help out and if all the goverments help then poverty can be defeated. if more people are working all across the world then poverty can be defeated everywhere.my second reason is the places not in poverty will probably have more than enough resources that the poor places need. if stable economies help out or let poor economies join them they both may be stronger as a result. for example, give unstable economies tools, advice, and medicine to start their own economy. once they are supplied help them by giving advice like how to boost morale to make everyone happier, more co-operative.my third reason is schools are where it all starts. if you don't have schools that means less pay for jobs no new ideas and no book smarts. if you do go to school you can go to college and get a better job and design or invent new things to help out your community or even the whole world. my fourth reason is determination. with determination you can do any thing. if the millennium village project didn't have determination they would have given up. sauri was in horrible shape but, that didn't stop the millennium village project from putting sauri in better condition. determination can solve any problem.if we have time, global

because when/as we get older then we can helpout with kenya because we have lots of materials & resources that they don’t have. another reason it is important to/for kids to know about kenya is because in there time/at this present time maybe if we look back into there history & see that they were poor had no food/no $ then maybe we all can learn a lesson from this because like i said, we have more advanced & better & more qualified materials than them, and these days kids & adults are spoiled, we have phones stores, houses & even shoes and clothes but they dont have any of that, but since we do we go out and by ourselves nice things with lots of money & don’t even think about giving some that $ to kenya where we can donate it to help there country because there in need.2004as i know that in 2004 a country called kenya a country in south africa, was a very poor & impoverished place. then the millenium there were many problem for ex: farmers crops died because they didnt have any $, people died from hunger parents couldnt afford school fees, & at school had no midday meals (lunch) on no school supplies. but children still were determined to learn & get a good education. another thing was that when patients went to hospitals, there were no doctors, water/electricity, and on top of that children & adults had to share beds. (there were 2-3 kids in one bed, & there was no $ for one drame. also in 2004 there was a diseases called malaria, a disease when a person is betten by a mosquito. but the good thing was that it was preventable, people had bed nets which cover up the bed so that no insects could get in but not many people had one. the country was just terrible. 2008then 2008 4 years later the /sauri was /had changed over the years, people didn’t have to pay for school fees farmers had fertilizer & seed to grow crops, generators at the hospital were used to/for electricity. the hospital had medicine, schools serve meals & attendance at school is up. which is very important because all kids didn’t go to school then they wouldnt have a good education/they wouldn’t learn anything. and if they didn’t have a education then when they get older they wouldnt have a job.conclusionit seem that over the yrs that many people & places have gotten better & progressed that’s good how/what happed. because

are that school fees are free and because of that more kids will grow and learn. they could grow up and use that knowlede and possable make a difference them selves. also, now that there are hospitals with water there will be so many more kids to survive, go to school, and possably make that difference. my last example is that there is fertilizer and that will grow food. that food can go in a

enough to change my mind about poverty. because of this i do not change my mind that we can stop poverty.although we can help slightly in the fight against poverty, it is not possible to completely halt it. once a person is homeless or in poverty they might resort to alchohol or try nothing to make money, they could have children or a child and the poverty cycle continues. in the article the author said that the poor are needing of supplies such as food, water and shelter. if someone does not have the essentials then how will they survive?without money, those essentials are not accessable to the poverish. as population increases the population of homeless people will also increase. this will make this problem grow too. it is better that we solve it now as it is smaller, then deal with it later. this is impossible as the united states are in debt.in the article it also states that school was not accessible to the poor. without a proper education you can’t get a job to support you. you might not even get a job. the article also states that health care is very important. if you don’t have proper health care then you could get sick and potentialy die.in conclusion, i think that we can’t solve poverty problems in the united states. because of the population increase, mixed with inflation, money will become worth less and less. it will still be hard to obtain enough

of time. they only had ten to eleven years which isn’t a lot of time to help a very proverty village. in the begininng of the article in 2004 when the author went to sauri they had nothing. they had no fertilizer and water to grow plants, bad education system, and a bad hospital. they didn’t have these things because their economy was bad and people didn’t have the money to buy things like education for their children or fertilizer to help their plants grow. but as the years pasted, the village of sauri, kenya got better. 	toward the end of the article in 2008 when the author revisits sauri, kenya, it was a lot better then the first time she went to visit. their farms were better because they had got some fertilizer for their plants and tools needed to maintain it, hospitals had medicine for the common diseases (maleria) and they had a generator inside the hospital for electricity, and finally they had a better education system so education was free to children and they also got an lunch and no one came home with no energy.	it took them four years to accomplish a lot of things they wanted. they got a better hospital, education, and food supply. this is the reason why

because there are no more school fees so children can have education and the school also has lunches. the farmers were supplied with seed, fertalizers and some farming equipment so they can provide enough food. the hospitals has medicine to treat most common diseases, free of charge so people will not die of many treatable diseases. water is now connected to hospitals which also generate electricity.	because of these reasons i think that the millennium villages project in sauri, kenya will succeed. the bed nets will help alot. mosquitos won’t infect as many people as before. the bed nets are very important because of that.	the education was improved greatly. the school fees were taken away. this is important because people couldn’t afford school fees. this gave kids education. the food was also served to kids. this was also improved because most people were too poor to afford a mid-day lunch.	the hospitals had medicine to cure many common diseases which were free of charge. it was free because the people wore very poor and lived on less than a dollar evyday. the hospital now had water which also generated electricity. these improvmets helped greatly yo cure more diseases. 	the farmers could not harvest their poorly raised which led to a hunger crisis. the hunger crisis was solved because the farmers were supplied with supplies with farming equipment,

medicines.	mostly the people in africa was in poverty. the couldn't afford most of the things that would save their lives. malaria is a disease which is found mostly in africa. it is caused by mosquitoes when they bite you at night. it is proventable if you get a bed net. since the people in africa was in poverty, they wasn't able to buy those bed nets even though it was only 5 dollars but now, they are able to buy bed nets and prevent malaria.	in 2004, africa was also had hunger issues, they didn't have food. africa's people had to plant to get their food. in 2004 the didn't have fertelizer to plant their food so they always was in hunger. but in 2008 they had enough fertelizer and seeds to plant in the farms. they were able to survive from their hunger.	last but now least, in the past africa wasn't able to pay for schools, schools fees, and the school lunches. in 2004 they had a lot of problems with schools. but in those 4 years of improvement, they didn't have any problems with schools. they didn't have any school fees and they were able to get food lunches. as you can see in the year 2008, africa was living a better life.	in just 4 years, africa was in poverty to outstanding accomplishment. they accomplished hunger, preventing diseases, and helping schools. the author showed that africa can accomplish many things to improve their lives. poverty was

hospital people had to share beds. the hospital wouldn’t have electricity or water it didn’t have a lot of medicine ider. there was a really common disease in africa wich you got from a mosquito bite. kids could die of this and adults could get very sick. the girl wanted to something about all this but there was still one more thing to see. she went to go see a farmer. the farmer couldn’t plant plants, he didn’t have water or fertilizer. if he planted a plant it will just die. every year the farmer wood get even more woried he might not be able to feed his whole family. his kids wodo get really sick. now the girl knew she was going to do something and she was going to help them. kids would also not go to school because their parents couldn’t aford to pay for the school. the schools wouldn’t have all the material they needed. the school wouldn’t have luch for the kids at midday this would make them not consentrate. at the end of the day the kids would be tired.	4 years later in 2008 the millennium villages project was created. this project would help the sub-sahara villages. now with the help of this project the government had more money they could pay the villagers more money. the hospitals now have enough beds for everyone. the would put bed nets on all the beds to prevent the disease of the mosquito bites. now they have electricity and water. they would have enough medicine for everyone. the farmers could now plant their crops. their families won’t go hungry. the schools would have be free kids would be able to go to school. they would have school lunch and would have enogh material. the people will also have new clothes. beacause of this project the lives of all those people in the villages changed now they have good lives. if i were the girl i would

“winning the fight against poverty is a chievable in our lifetime.”  now i have stated my opion, if you are looking for a happy opion, put this paper down and read someone else’s paper because this does not have a happy answer, keep reading to find out more about my opion.    we can not win the fight against poverty because of a few things:  at the tine people only lived on $1 and the bed nets treated with chemicals that last for 5 years only cost $5 but if you are living on only $1 a day would you want to spend 5 precious dollars when your whole family is starving to the bone?  also you might have a lot of kids and a few beds so that would mean even more than just 1 bed net.     the medical is also bad over in kenya.  there are 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed, and packed with patients that would not receive treatment because of space, or because of money.  there was no doctor or running water of electricity, it is a very painful way to die in those hospitals.     many people could not find jobs at that village or anywhere else.  it is like that because to find a good paying job would require an education like the one we have now, but it is different in kenya because the village there barly allows you to go to school and when you do there are no supplies, or mid-day lunch.  i would find it hard to concrtate if i did not eat in the middle of school.  afterschool, the kids have no more energy after that, they still need to help with the chores, fetch wood, bring water, tend to the crops, ect.  their lives are very terrible.     money is everything, anytime, anywhere, who ever holds the money holds the power.  money is something that is needed for everything it is the most common answer for everything:  why don’t you have enough food?

time.  not everyone here will give up any of that.  that is why it has not convinced me that winning the war against poverty can be won in a lifetime, mabey 5, 10, 20.",11302_020019316.docx,"no, i

their basics. on paragraph 5 it says each net causes $5 and 20,000 kids die from the disease so its more than just 20-40 people who are poor their entire city is so they have a better chance. i am convinced that you can beat poverty but it is alot harder nowadays depending on where you are at. in this story it says everyone earns less than a dollar each day now they won’t even let homeless people into the buildings. 	the people with the best chance of winning agaisnt poverty is gonna be people with jobs but are really poor. because they can work until they get enough money for school

beat poverty nowadays is like i said earlier they only hire people with experince or at least a high school graduation.	for people that are poor they can either stay with that job until they get more

some people can save their money for important things in life except for the other people that spend their money when they get money. that's why people are poor now and days. i don't think by the time i die it will not be poor people because people must their life, money, and time for things the don't need and when they go broke then they want to go back a life and change everything that why my answer is no.",11131_020012382.docx,"i feel that winning the fight against poverty can be possible in our lifetime. now, i know that there are lots of places in the world with people who are poor, but like the article said, it only took 4 years to improve sauri’s economy, so it’s just a matter of time before proverty is a thing of the past	we can look at sauri, kenya as an example. back in 2004, the hospitals didn’t have medicine or treatments for diseases, even malaria. you can use bed nets to prevent malarial mosquitoes from coming at you and it only costs $5 to us, $5 is really cheap. but to the people of sauri, $5 is very expensive. this shows just how poor they are. but now, 4 years later, every sleeping site of sauri has bed nets and hospitals have medicine. people are living healthier and longer. 	another way sauri is an example that we can overcome poverty is their agriculture. when the author of the article went to sauri, she saw that most of the crops were dying because they lacked fertilizer and water. this can affect their health if they don’t have enough food to eat. but within four short years, sauri is given fertilizer, seeds, and tools to be able to maintain a food supply. 	and a third example of how sauri is like a role-model to ending poverty is their education. where the article is set in 2004, the education rate was low. schools had a limited amount of books, papers, pencils, and even students. schools lacked these things because they were considered expensive. students had to pay fees to go to school and since most sauri children were poor, they couldn’t go to school. even though they couldn’t, the children wanted to learn. their desires will be fulfilled in the coming years. by 2008, sauri families no longer had to pay fees and many children now get an education. 	within 4 years, sauri, kenya has changed a lot. in 2004, they were an impoverished village. by 2008, most people had been lifted out of poverty as they have been able to overcome diseases, agricultural, and educational problems. let us look at sauri, kenya as an example, role-model, and the beginning of a world without poverty.",4122691Y3_100245753.docx,"yes, because in the article. it seemed like the was wining the fight against poverty. she/  he  has talking in this article . i know it wasn’t a easy job for them.  l ife for them is very hard . if they stay strong and keep it up they will live.",11351_020053161.docx,"is winning the fight achievable in our lifetime?  some people might say yes while others might say no but the millenium viallages project showed us that changing the lives of many people in poverty into a brighter future was possible in just a few years.  half the population in the world is in poverty but just as much people is not in poverty.  if we get enough people together to help we can win this fight against poverty, and there is a lot of people in the world willing to help.  the millenium village project brought many people out of food crisis and gave them the items needed to make people’s lives better, and it did the trick.one of the reasons it changed people’s lives is that it brought them out of the food crisis.  it was easy.  all they had to do was give the people in the villages in africa fertilizers and seed to grow crops along with the tools needed and soon the villagers had enough food to eat.  the adults got the energy to work and the kids can concentrate on school.  soon the school even have enough food to serve free lunch.  some people might think that we might not have enough money to help them.  i think that we can do this because millenium villages showed us with eighty villages with about five hundred people in each whose lives they have changed dramatically over ten years and they never ran out of money because of the millions of people out there donated about maybe a dollar each.the villages also got all sorts of public services needed out there.  the hospitals got medicine for almost every common diseases and every bed out there has a bed net to keep mosquitoes that malaria, a disease that once killed 20,000 people a day, away.  also, the hospitals now has running water and electricity generaters.  the schools got the supplies needed such as books.  they serves lunch, and much more people to go to the schools.  the schools and hospitals were free of charge, powered by the money given by millenium village to help the people in poverty.some people may say that project like the millenium village can’t cover all the people in poverty in the world.  i disagree with this statement because many people helps with projects like the millenium village and more people will help once they heard of it.  maybe their resources can only be stretch as far, but there are more projects than just the millenium village.  there always more people who’s willing to help, but not always are there people in poverty.  maybe one day some really rich person will devote himself to fighting poverty.  people often do not go back into poverty.  dramatic changes can be done in a few years, as it is proved by many times.  the fight against poverty can be won in our lifetime.in conclusion, winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.  maybe one group of people is not able to go any farther, but there’s always more people and more donation.  people can be no longer in poverty in just a few years if we focus on helping them, and they can hold their own once we show them how.  the fight againest poverty can be won

if they can improve in four years then its most likely they can improve in another 17 years. the people of sauri have been provided with fertilizer and seeds, which helped elimitnate the problem of hunger. hospitals and medicine have been provided so they don’t have to worry about not being able to pay for medicine. and there are no school fees, so kids can go to school and are provided lunch so

bigger impacts on several other villages, towns, cities, etc. one other reason why i am considering on doubting them is because the images thier working on is common to many people .ways the world

was very persuasive. sauri, kenya used to be poor because they were paid $1 per day, and the could not afford bed nets, medicine, and treatments for the disease, malaria. this preventable disease was causing people to die and experience ""near-death"". malaria can be prevented, but the $5.00 bed net is expensive in sauri. this reminds me of the time i couldn't afford a $5 rock that was very rare. like the people in sauri, i gained enough money to by it.      the kids of sauri could not go to school, due to the expensive fee. they needed school supplies, but they also couldn't afford it, because they were too poor. however, the people of sauri have no school fees, and the school supplies are now affordable, and my inference is that the government gave sauri the money to meet their needs. i like how the author gave a good example, but i wish the author added more information about sauri gaining the money to meet their needs.      another problem in sauri was the fact that plants needed fertilizer in order to live and grow. my opinion is that if vegetarians rely on the plants to grow, the government should've given them money sooner to afford the supplies plants, as well as poor people need to live. if the plants die, the possibility of people dying would be very high. this is why i think the quote ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our

hard and it will be even harder in the future. i agree with the author the road is a hard one. with almost 80 villages taking 4 years with one it will not be easy to complete at all. if we stop poverty we may be able to stop all common illnesses. now that sauri is better they have water in hospital. students are left with no energy at the end schoool but did change, now schools give lunch and stop no energy for all students. now i think the author will stop tattered clothes and give new clothes in or on or before 2015 and 2025. this shows us that we can stop do it if we all help in africa we can come to world health meaning that we live longer by helping another. so, i agree fulling with the author, hannah sachs, we can help start a change, we stop poverty. we can stop this problem. we can end this, we can save kids and elders. we can save the world. if we stop hungry kids, people won't worry about death and sicknesses. we can end world

well, you can do something to help stop poverty. help is needed for these people in kenya. i firmly believe that the author did provide a convincing argument that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. in the text, the author states that between the year 2004-2008 we have seen a lot of improvement. the people in kenya now have free food, an education, electricity everywhere, water, clothing, shoes, hospital beds, bed nets, no school fees, supporters, donators, organizations, vaccine shots, and community development. i feel this way because people in kenya have suffered like those in haiti when some storms hit them. they had no water, food, shelter, electricity, clothes, shoes, or money to survive. so, then they had to starve, but when they starved, they died because they had no treatment nor medicine to help them get better. i feel that those who have nothing can have something better in their lives. in the year 2004, there were women on the dusty ground selling bananas for money. everyday when kid got sick, 3 children were in 1 bed with each other. when an adult got sick, they shared 1 bed with 1 adult. there was a disease called malaria that killed 20,000 children a day. there was no doctor in the hospital. most people couldn’t have treatment because they never had it or couldn’t pay for it. children had to go a whole day with only 1 meal and that was only breakfast. in 2008, schools serve lunches to children. to kill the disease malaria they had bed nets to keep children safe and disease free. now the people have fertilizer and soil and water to grow crops for food to survive. by the years 2015 and 2025, the people will have an even better life because of the supplies that they have in their village. it seems as though they will live a long time because of the items they have. hospital medicines are free of charge. they have water and electricity connected into the rooms. the children are getting a better education. if more

 sauri also has free education and a little more money for use.  the second reason i believe poverty can be ended is because the sauri citizens have begun living with more food supplies.  they now have fertilizers, tools for farming, and seeds.  their once impoverished community and bodies now have more to eat which means more energy to build on their homes and lifestyle.  my last reason why i believe poverty can be stopped is because of support.  since these dramatic changes have happened in sauri and other villages, people around the world will definitely, pour their support into this

day kids and adults in sauri are now happy and joyful that they have been cared for and know that there are people in the world who can help you beat poverty and illness. so if you take a trip to africa come to sauri and help everybody’s lives a better place to live in. and more that the author convinced me about is that sauri had a little help from nets but not enough to kill the illness but it could not stop kids from dying each day. and that now with the help of the hospital kids do not starve to death or wear tattered clothing and now kids are wearing clean cloths and stomachs full

am not really good in school. i don’t really like school but i understand how important learning is. kids over in sauri would love to have a good education like i do. my last reason would be because

gave you examples of what they needed such as medical supplies and food, the tried to make you feel sad and wanting to help. then they said how an average person could help make a difference by donating one dollar. the essay then showed you how much 1 dollar could help. it really made me happy knowing that everyone could make a difference.secondly they used information. they gave exact examples of how much they needed help. for example they said that “20000 african kids die every day from malaria.” when a reader sees that, they get surprised at the large number, much more affective than just saying “a large amount.”lastly they essay explained itself. it explained what malaria is and how it affected people. it showed when malaria mosquitos come out and how they can be prevented. the essay gives backround information such as what the millennium villages project is and how it helps. backround information is im-portant because if you choose a topic that is hard to follow then a reader could be confused about the entire essay.there are 3 large and very important reasons why the essay “a brighter future” convinced me i could make a difference. if you are writing an essay i strongly encourage you to take all of these reasons into account.",3112601Y3_000511846.docx,"yes, because the author showed what happened in just {4} years to the village of suari.

small children shared, {3} to a bed and adults {2} to a bed. now days the hospital has {1} person to {1} bed. another example is that few kids used to go to school, but now school is free so all kids can go to school and learn. example 3 is that only a few people had bed net to protect them from the misquitos which carried malaria. now every house has a bed net. my last example is that now all hospitals have running water which also has a generator attached to it. before they would have to go to a lake or river and get water, which at the same time was unclean and carried diseases. now they

bare foot which makes it more possible for them to get infected.	the buildings in sauri were probrobly filthy & dirty. those are bad conditions for schools, markets, especially homes, & hospitals because if these conditions will allow sicknesses to spread. if the hospitals are torn-up & filthy it will be hard for a pacient to recover because air can be contaminated & the pacient make much

didn’t get a proper education since they had to work to have a place to live in.within 4 years the millennium project has fixed major problems in sauri. for example, they provided students get a better education. with a proper education they can be able to get a good/better job making them get better things in life. another is that they have medicine, water, & proper condition for hospitals curing more pacients of diseases such as malaria. they also have food for the people with seeds that they can plant to have more food & fertilizer & tools too. they did so much more helpful & useful

the fight against poverty. though there are improvement in the areas of sauri/africa, there are still going to be people in poverty. an organization may be supporting the people there now, but can they depend on themselves? what if the millennium villages project did not exist anymore would sauri slowly fall back into poverty? we do not know what will happen in the future, but we all there has been poverty around world as far as we all remember. the progress being made from the millennium village project shows us that this world is slowly evolving,, and the poverty rate is getting lower. some people may say if we keep developing new ways to help the people of africa or people in poverty we may be able to win the fight against poverty. no, this problem is bigger than we think, all we can do is try our best to improve these problems. just like questions that are impossible to answer, we cannot answer them, all we can do is guess, infer, and think. that is what we are doing to help hard hit places. we think of new ways to improve lives, just like how the passage informed us about that. an example of not being able to improve everybodys’ life would be preventing diseases. there will always be new diseases (whether we like it or not), and keeping up to date on the vaccinations is hard. we may not be able to end poverty in the world, but we could try to improve the world as

hope that their children wouldn't go hungry. this problem was also fixed. now families have fertilizer and seeds to help plant crops. also, sauri is winning against poverty because before 20,000 kids died each day from malaria. now, bed nets are on every bed. bed nets save millions of lives. lastly, before there wasn't any water in a hospital and there were 2 to 3 people in one bed. now hospitals have electric generators and running water. the hospitals also have free medicine for common diseases. these dramatic changes have shown that sauri will come out the victor in this war against

from kids.now second of all learning about the struggles in kenya before and after the millenium villages project could make kids like me more thankful for what they have and not take it for granted.

problems. but changes have been made in kenya thanks to the millenium villiges project.well in conclusion kenya has had it’s struggles but like they said dramatic changes have happened like water in

poverty achievable within our lifetime? i think that we cannot. why? because when you give some supplies for one village, and another, and another, one village will run out of the supplies. of course, i don’t know the full story, so i cannot justify. but i do have a reason: sauri is only one village. there are hundreds of other villages who need supplies too. by the time in about 90 years, sauri will need maintenence, and so will other villages. it will go in an endless loop.	but what if we do supply enough resources for the villages? that will be a very difficult thing, and it might be achievable. it will take millions of dollars. for example if every village in kenya has 100 people, one hospital, seeds, and maintenance fees, it will add up to about $6000 per village. and there are over 200,000 villages, if not a million, in kenya. the price would total up to about $6,000,000,000! six billion dollars. if someone were to pay, then it would be plausable. but until someone does contribute that much, it will be impossible.	winning the fight for zero poverty is a maybe-maybe situation. people will have to donate more than six billion dollars for this. we will need to constantly supply the villages with seeds, water, fertilizers, and will have to maintain the hospitals. i don’t think that zero-poverty will be possible. not in the near future at least. this is my

big improvement. the hospital had medicen, free of charge, for all diseases. it was a big deal because before they didn't have all those tools to help the sick.	millennium village didn't have the

way was impoving the hospital in sauri. when they got to the hospital, they saw patients waiting to get treated, a clinic officer (there were no doctors), no water system or electrical system. most of the patients can’t be cure because they can’t afford it or there no medicine for the disease. to help them, the millennium villages project provide them with medicine, water and electricity. 	other way that the millennium villges project helpped was by helpping farmers and schools. the farms in sauri had little water and no fertilizer. they barely have seeds to plant more crops. in schools, they had school fee so they could get more supplies. also, there is no lunchtime there as well. to help this problem, the millennium villages project provide them farmer with water, fertilizer, water and seeds. the school recieved school supplies which makes the school fee to nothing and school now provides lunch for the kids. 	the millennium villages projects had helpped sauri in many ways. for example; the millennium villages project helpped the hospital by giving medcine, water and electricity for them or helpped farmers by giving the fertizer, water and seeds or helpped the school by

to care about other people less fortunate than us in the world, emotional and physically. this girl (my age) put up a fabulous, well thought out article about what's happening in other parts of the world and what is being done to help poverty-striken areas. hannah sachs (the author) talks about how the families in sauri, kenya earn only about $1 a day. mosquitoes carry a (preventable) disease called malaria and a simple way to solve this problem is to buy a bet net to keep the mosquitoes away from people as they sleep in sauri. these nets only cost $5 each, but because people in sauri only make about $1 a day, they cant really afford that. it made me think about how carelessly i use $5 to buy useless junk. how easy it is for me to just go into target and purchase a  $5 item that i dont need or use up and forget about it. it make me think about how i can give back to those less fortunate, all at the will of $5. another problem that struck me was the lack of medical supply. when hannah went into a hospital in sauri, she described it as ""the room was packed with patients who probably would not receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it."" that setting alone got me upset. and distraught. all those people have common, even curable diseases which they die from each day. what we take as a regular household cold, is a life or death situation for them. if money could go toward expanding the hospitable, then those patients wouldn't be so cramped and get the medical attention they need and deserve. medical supply can be bought so that these people can be treated a healthy. kids die every day form that. and thats sad.      hunger. hunger is a problem that we know as world wide. people in sauri, actually, kids is sauri, suffer from lack of or no food at all. people die, everyday, from that. but there is a way to stop this. something as simple as starting a local food drive in you community, or even donating a

progress was made, especially with hospitals and treating diseases like malaria. to go from no water, electricity, or medicine; to having all of those things, keeps people in poverty healthier.

therefore, more people would have the energy to work and study which would lead them to a better life in the future. “the hunger crisis has been addresed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food suply.” this shows me that there would have less people starving so they would have energy to do things like working for money. “there is no school fees, and the school now serve lunch for the students”. the students would have the energy to continue learning after lunch, and more people would go to school because it’s free. more students learning = more people with a better job in the future = more money for the job. “bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri”. this would mean that they will not have a disease called mallaria. that would save the time for them to not go to the hospital and would use he time for studying or working. if these thing keeps happening for the future 40 years, i think that it would be really hard for us to loose

down. this proves that if there wer eplenty of more crops in 80 villiges, then by 2015 maybe it can the whole country! 	also, before over 20,000 kids died because of a dei0seise that can be easily cured called malaria. by 2008 every hospital had abed net that keeps out mosquitoes that carry malaria. less people catch the deseise. which emean less people die from it. 	anothe example is in the

they are in poverty and once people help them they will come out of provety. another reson why i think that they can help fight against poverty is they already have so much goals and targets that they

recieve treatment, either because the hospital didn’t have it or they couldn’t afford it. their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. if they won the

hasn't convinced me that we can win the fight against poverty within our life times. poverty is a huge massive thing of pain and suffering that covers our world. people are in short supply for medecine that hey need. all the money that they have to spend a day is $1. here's another thing. all the mony we donate makes a difference, yes, but what will happen to those people when we stop giving them all that money?     poverty is a big mass of pain and fear, any where somebody is starving. poverty will be hard to stop. any way, you can't stop poverty because a soon as you stop one area's poverty, somebody else goes hungry. as hannah said, ""dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages accross sub-saharan africa."" 80 villages is a lot of people. just think, if there are 80 villages being helped, how many are not being helped? there are billons of people in the world. only a small fraction are rich. after the recession, the middle class began to fall apart based on how most people didn't have jobs so they couldn't pay money for their taxes. why else would people like barack o'bama and mitt romney be foucusing on the middle class. pretty soon, the world will be made out of ""rich"" people and ""poor"" people. poverty will be pretty hard to stop, like hannah says, and no matter what, someone will go hungry.      each day 20,000 kids die from disease and each day, more kids that are sick fill the place of the missing ones. every time a person gets brought into a hospital and there's no medicine, they can die very quickly. sometimes the people simply can't afford the medicine. all those deaths. while since then conditions have improved, all over the world, people are dying from disease we don't suffer from anymore. how many have died from this poverty? how can we win a war against something so big?      people in impoverished villages like the one hannah went to have $1 a day to spend on the bare necesities of life. we pour thousands of dollars into these projects, but even with this money, there are still millions of people out there in the world who are hungry. there is only so much money in the world. some people are so generouse they throw themselves into poverty trying to help others. for every village we help, someone goes hungry. over the years, people have become reliant on benefactors, well, as soon as one place is up and running, we move money someplace else. sometimes areas once rich in support slip back into poverty.      there is poverty all over the world. to stop it is impossible because of the nature of money. as long as there is value in the world, there is always someone with less of it. so, how can we cure the world? the answer is we can't, we can only improve it, and even that is a very challenging task.",2112501Y2_000511554.docx,"yes, i believe that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. i think this because at first the hospital in sauri was run-down, without water, electricity, or proper medicines.  if the hospital did have the medication, than the family most likely could not pay for it. now more people can be treated and can afford the medication. with running water and electricity health problems can surely be minimized.   another topic that can help the fight against poverty us with farming. before there was not much fertilizer or proper irrigation. the farmers were also worried about not feeding their families, or that their children would die firm starvation. now with the millennium villages project families have fertilizer, seeds, and proper irrigation. with those products hunger in sauri can be reduced, as well as deaths.     finally, there are better school benefits. at first, due to lack of supplies, food, and money many children didn't get an education. without money you couldn't pay for supplies or food. also, without lunch children would lose energy and not be able to concentrate on work. now there is more money, supplies, and food for the students to have a successful day.     so in conclusion, i believe we can win the fight against poverty. now that sauri has better crops, hospitals and education the area of sauri

the fight against poverty” is possible in our lifetime even with help of the people around us. everywhere around us, there are people too poor to afford healthcare, food, and/or education. what they need is a little boost from those willing to help. in the article, hannah sachs mentioned the changes made in sauri, kenya in about four years’ time. if we were to make these changes happen worldwide, we would need a lot more people willing to donate money that obviously won’t come from the impoverised countries. if it takes four years to stabilize one village in sauri,  then just imagine how long it would take to stabilized the rest of kenya.	i think “ winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime” if we were talking about fighting against it in one or two countries but to win the fight worldwide it would take generations of people willing to fight for that cause. in every generation, people would required millions of dollars in funds to supply the poverty-stricken areas of the world with what they need to survive both physically and economically. we would also need people to teach the country’s leaders how to spend the large (or small) amount of money they’re given.	no matter how you look at it, the problem comes down to money and funds from people who are willing to help. there is an unlikely chance of winning the fight against poverty and i’d have to

avalible. a misquito net that cost only five dollars was something that most families could not afford; hospitals were over crowded and many people couldn’t afford basic medical treatments. there was no water or electricity. but in only four short years the hospital was transformed into a medical center that could be found in the us. people could get free treatments, there was medicine, people had clean water and could see a doctor. 	farming in sauri was very hard. without things like fertilizer or irrigation crops could easily die and leave a family without food. the people in sauri had to struggle in order to eat. when the millenium project gave farmers the tools they needed to grow crops the quality of life vastly improved. all in only four years.	many children in sauri didn’t go to school. those who did found that there weren’t enough things such as books and pencils. the majority of students didn’t eat a midday meal and therefore had no energy by the end of the day. four years later the number of students has increased. they now recieve lunch and have enough school supplies.	life for the people of sauri has vastly improved. all with very simple things in a short amount of

who probably would not recieve treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it so people could change that from people having no money and being sick to people being rich and healthy as a horse. also if people can be a big support then maybe we can reach the goal from getting people out of poverty to year 2013. so we could get children and adults to have overfilled stomachs from nothing inside them. in the paragraph ""water, fertilizer, knowledge"" it says ""many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford school fees."" so the kids couldn't have any education or knowledge just because the parents only had less than a dollar a day, so i really think that the winning fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. but the real main idea is that we will achieve in the fight against poverty.",31391_020010435.docx,"this article was about the millennium development goals and making a difference in poverty in sauri. after reading this, it has convinced me to believe that there is a chance to win against poverty in a lifetime. the article gives strong examples of the changes already made so far.	sauri started off as a very poor place. for example, in this article it states that, ""at that time, the people of sauri lived on less that $1 a day"" (1). with this fact alone, it is obvious that there needed to be big changes. not only did they only live off less than a dollar, but they also had a hospital packed with sick children and adults with ony a clinical officer to aid to all of them. there was also no electricity nor running water. this sight was unbearable to the author's eyes. the majority of the sick people also had preventable diseases like malaria that could've been prevented with only a $5 bed net. it was such a simple task yet not everyone could've afforded to do it. in addition to the hospital, the author also states that, ""many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford the fees"" (2). the handful of students that did attend school had to struggle through with only books, paper, and a pencil. they were always out of energy within the end of the day. the last thing that the author talked about was farmers. farmers always worries that they could not feed their family because they had no fertilizer nor irragation to grow crops. this was a big problem ebcause this would cause many people to die of starvation.	even with all these problems, the millennium village project people worked hard to solve them. first off, they started letting electricity circulate throughout the hospital and provide medcine free of charge. that was a very big change that can prevent many people from dying. the article also states that, ""there are no school fees, and now the school serves lunch for students"" (1). this action caused many students to now attend school. the farmers also now have more seeds and fertilizer. now, there is a bed net in every sleeping site in sauri. all of this changed in only four years. this was all thanks to the milleinnium village project.	with all these amazing changes that have already started to happen in sauri, how can you not be convinced? with this project, i believe that it is definitely possible to win against out fight against poverty. for this to work, i do agree with the author that the world has to work together to change this. it may not be the easiest thing ever, but it is achievable.",4128601Y2_000496940.docx,"the hospital now’s provide medication for the sick

poverty” is achievable. i believe its achievable because the costs of medicine isn’t too high so people should be able to donate a reasonal amount of money to help people’s life. 	if bed nets only cost five dollars, people should be able to donate that amount because its a reasonable amount. five dollars can save a person from dying of malaria. 	farmers and their families also have hard times. farmers live in the fear that their crops won’t grow because they cannot aford the proper fertlizer and irrigation. without their crops their families can suffer. their family could starve and become sick, or even worse die of starvation. if they had proper fertilizer and irrigation, they wouldn’t have to live in fear.	children also suffer. unlike us, we fortunatly have school, while children in sauri don’t hget a chance at education. they dont get the privlage of education like us because their families cannot aforde the school fees. the school can hardly afford supplies as well. in 2004, the school had very little supplies but the children still worked hard and tried their best to concetrate. schools also didn’t have midday meals, so children were low on energy. some kids did chores such as fetching water and wood instead of attending school. 	people in sauri are suffering. they don’t have or get the privilages we do, but i do believe we can change that.",2134501Y2_000496130.docx,"134501y2_ 000496130instead of donating 1 dollar to a person i would donate about 20 because i remember when homeless people used to come up to my mom’s car window she would close it in their fares and she said its to protect us but i said give to some to love for so they can eat instead of live homeless if they ask for change give them like five dollars for food instead they might but small things. if bed nets save millions of people lives thats good because they look for better things in the future and dont pass away while in poverty they might look forward to having children. so i will donate a lot of bed net to save people lives.last i will donate fertilizer so farmers could feed their wives and kids os they could have a good life like having

children to school we sent them to school but they didnt have food so by the end of the day the children dont have the right amount of energy they need so we payed for food to give them. the people

others and the achieved the goal in just four year. i think that maybe in a couple of year that the other cuntries will also be improved if we all help and work hard to make them better for the poeple

against poverty is achieveable in our lifetime"".	my first reason for thinking this way is because of how much the millenium villages project has improved medical funding in sauri, kenya. back in 2004, sauri could barely hold up a hospital. the hospital had no water and electricity. these are two logical utilities that a public health center needs. inside, 3 children or 2 adults would share a bed. the hospital would be so packed with people, they could probably not have enough medicines to help the sick and dying people.	the second reason i have for believing we can win against poverty is how much food and farming has improved. not many farmers could get good crops. 1) they didn't have very good tools. fertilizer could help solve this problem. the fertilizer helps increase quantity and quality of crops, so this could help with the problem of ""not enough food for the family"". 2) they didn't have enough water. plants need two things to flourish, sunlight and water. now, because of the big changes made, farmers have a good supply of water, fertilizer, seeds, and tools.	the next reason i present is how school funds have improved. in 2004, if you went into a classroom, you would not see many children in there. most children could not afford it or they were needed at home. schools would often not have very many supplies. because of the millenium villages project, there are no school fees and schools have better supplies. they also serve lunches, something many to no schools had to offer.	my last and final reason is that this help from millenium villages has spread to several other places. many other villages in sub-saharan africa has changed drastically. many people now do not live in poverty, attend school, have enough food and water for the family, and have medicine.	in conclusion, i think that we can win this fight. seeing these changes make me think this way.",4109591Y2_000491144.docx,"how the quality of life can be improve by the millenium village

get medicine, food, water, fertilizer, and supplies. less people get out of provety because things become affortable. kids are able to get lunches now that food is provided at school. because of this

there wasn’t a lot of beds, there were 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed. also there alot of people with preventable diseases, like malaria, which comes from mosquitoes. bed nets that prevent it are only $5, but people cant afford it there. 4 years later the hopital had free medicine for the common health problems, and bed nets are used at every sleeping site in sauri. 	another way is that in 2004 at the farms there were dying crops because they couldn’t afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. every time they planted seeds the crops would die from no water and fertilizations. 4 years later, in 2008, they gonea fertilizer, seeds, and water, so their crops were flourishing.	the last reason is that in 2004, many kids did not attend school because they didnt have enough money

third, there is a big chance men and women won't donate.	poverty will not be over by 2015 because we have a little over 2 years to fix the problem. even if we had billions and billions of dollars to do this, we wouldn't be able to reach every impovershed village, every starving child, or every needy person. i do think we've made incredible progress, but there is sill so much to do. it we were to get rid of poverty, we would need to stretch the deadline at leas 10 years. that's why i think under 3 years isn't enough time.	many people don't know about the millennium villages project. i had never even heard of it before today! in fact, im pretty sure most of my class had never heard of it before today, a lot of people watch the news, look at online news, or read newspapers, but people don't really watch those stories! also, a lot of people are out of touch from reality and don't pay attention to the news at all. that's what i believe about the millennium villages project.	finally many people don't want to donate money. some might just be very greedy. others might not have enough money to donate. and, like i said in the previous paragraph, some might not know about this project. people now a days have lots of things on their mind. they might just forget to give money. the people who do end up donating are very few. they might now give enough money to help.	in conclusion, i think that we won't tread poverty by 2015 because we don't have enough time and enough people knowing & donating to the millennium villages project. maybe someday we will have no

villages in 4 years. there are millions of villages out there that need help. so, if you did your math right, it would take 5,000 years to help 1,000,000 villages! also, you would need more money and volunteers (see next paragraph). a counter argument to this reason would be something like: if everybody supports, we could reach our goal. well, my rebuttal would state that not everybody would support.	my second reason revolves around the fact that it would cost trillions to help everyone. first, we would need electricity for everybody. second, we would need water. third, we'd need school supplies for schools. next, we would have to supply medicine for the hospitals, and much much more. one of my classmates says that if everybody contributes one dollar or so, we might have enough. my counter to that counter argument would say that not everybody would contribute (poor people, people not intrested, etc.) and that 7 billion is not enough.	my last reason is that nobody knows about it. to fix this you will need a handful of volunteers, money for advertising (signs on billboards, commertials, ads, etc.) and a big amount of time to get everything organized. a counter argument would be: people will volunteer, others will donate for advertisement, and the rest will try to contribute somehow.

nets for free. i think that because its not fear to them to not get paid alot, and then waste it all on the nets. they need other things too. at the time the people of sauri lived on less then $1 dollar a day. the nets cost $5. so they had to work for about a week to get a net. the kids or adult would have alread problaby died if they were that suverer. 	dramatic changes have occured in 80

important cause of deaths. farmers are trying to grow crops and produce food themselves but it’s impossible to have decent results when crops are constantly dying. fertilizers are constantly needed

not to get malaria but since the country is so poor that can’t afford it. since malaria is spread at night by mosquitoes their are bed nets to keep people from getting malaria. bed nets are treated with a chemical and can last up to 5 years but a bed net cost $5 which most of the country cannot afford.	another problem before the millenium village project is lack of water and fertilizer. most families try to do subsistence farming but it does not work out. subsistence farming is where a farmer grows crops to only meet the famalies needs. a family will plant seeds hoping for food to grow only to see that their is a lack of crops because their is no fertizer or water to help the crops grow. most kids in kenya do not attend school. the fees for school are high so parents cannot afford

i do not believe that poverty will ever be completely eradicated from our world, much less in our life time, i do believe that with hard work, support, and programs like the millennium villages project, we can dramatically improve the lives and living condition of the underprivelaged and impoverished. the progress of the millenium project clearly illustrates just how much we can achieve when we unite under the interest of helping the poor and improving lives. with effort, generosity, and dedication, we can work to set the world on a path to economic and social equality.one example of the dramatic and astonishing improvements made under the millennium project is the upgrade of the yala sub-district in sauri, kenya. what was, in 2004, an old, broken-down, under equipped, and understaffed establishment, the hospital become, by 2008 and with the help of the millenium project, a free, well-equipped, and well-supplied center for healing. this one example of an accomplishment for the fight against poverty shows just how much of a positive and transformative difference we can make in the lives of impoverished and underprivelaged.other instances that show how the quality of life has been improved in sub-saharan africa are the upgrades in farming (with the donations of seeds and fertilizers), improved school systems and school attendance, and the introduction of bed nets (which protect people from malaria/mosquitos) to all sleeping places in sauri. there are yet more ways in which the lives of the poor are changing for the better and that show how we are triumphing over poverty. with major changes in 80 villages in the sub-saharan region of africa, the millennium project has proved itself as a template for banishing poverty from out modern

she have many reason to support that idea : the changes of farming, the supplies of both schools and hospital.	the changes of farming is really important. for example, before the start of the project, crops are dying because the farmer cannot afford fertilizer and irrigation. which cause there are not enough food to feed the whole family. therefore many children died from hunger. during the year of 2008, the fertilizar and water replaced hunger, and while other tools maintain the food supply. thing change help to start build up wealth.  	the increase of supply in schools and hospitals help keep people from dying and help poor people to have knowledge. at the year 2004, the author stated that even the people that can afford to go to school but they aways run out of energy and be absent for some days because of lack of food and energy. a common diease that is treatable call malaria killed at least 20,000 kids per day. bed nets is/can keep mosqutos with malaria away but is cost $5 each. people in sauri with the average $1 per day cannot afford it. which causes people dying from a disease that is preventable. during mid-way of the program, there is no hospital/school fee, and bed nets is used in every sleeping site. 	just in 4 years. the village sauri have a dramatic change that changes its future. people from poor starting to built wealth because of the

community.  an reason for that is villages get technical advice and practical items, such as fertilizer, medicine, and school suplies but they dont get enough.anotehr explanation is in a hospital called the yala sub-district hospital there are not that many hospital beds and in each there are either 3 children or 2 adults in each.  the hospital was run by a clinical officer with no doctors in the building.  there was no running water or electricity; however, they used water from nearby rivers or lakes.i think winning the fight against poverty is acheivable.  we could send materials from the u.s. or from china or japan to help.  researchers could bring supplies with them to sauri and africa to help the whole sub-continent of africa.  we could also bring doctors and teachers with us to africa and hire them to the schools and hospitals.again poverty is hurting people and is suffering the people of africa.  i think that we can win the fight against poverty because we have power, we

convince me that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime”. the starts with the fact that sauri is in poverty. thanks to the millennium villages project, sauri become a more enjoyable place. the project worked on health, water, fertilizer, and knowledge until it finally paided off in 2008.	at beginning sauri was poor and seemed imcomplete. they almost had nothing to be happy about. all that they had to keep their spirits up was their music and singing. the rodes in sauri were unpaved and bumpy. people were on the dusty ground selling bananas. and little kids were wrapped in cloth on their mothers’ backs, or running around in bare feet and tattered clothing. 	when the millennium villages project came to sauri in 2004, they noticed how bad the hospitals were. to be specific the yala sub-district hospital. it was in horrible shape. not everyone was able to have their own bed. the rooms were full with patients who probably would not recieve treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it. there was no doctor, only a clinical officer running the hospital. and there was no running water or electricity. the main cause to almost all of this sickness is malaria which is from a mosquito bite. it can kill kids easily, and get adults very sick.	the crops were all dying because they couldn’t afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. families can’t be fed with the amount of crops planted. and many kids in sauri didn’t attend school because the parents couldn’t afford it. the schools didn’t have enough supplies for the kids and kids could concentrate since they got no lunch. 	 in a four year period sauri had made amazing progress. the hospitals had medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases. water and electricity is connected to the hospitals. beds have bed nets to prevent mosquitos with malaria. they have been given the tools needed to maintain the food supply. there are no school fees, and the schools now serve lunch.	so now thanks to the millenium village project, sauri is now not in poverty and can live peacefully without or much things to worry

several reasons why. 	firstly, the world is huge. they might have helped 80 villages, but there are probably hundreds more out in the world. the author says herself “it will not be an easy task.” i think that we don’t have the resources to give everything needed to every village in the world. it’s just not pratical.	secondly, see how long it took to help just one village to get up to pratical and useful materials? 4 years. that is 1/3 of my entire life. if most villages in poverty are this bad, think how long it will take to help all of the villages in need. the author says “the people of sauri have made amazing progress in 4 years.” i focus on the 4 years part of the statement. an average person lives to about 75-80. there is just not enough time. 	thirdly, i don’t know if enough people are willing to go and help. my family would, but we need thousands, mabey even hundreds of thousands of families to help. i don’t think enough people would get off their lazy butts and go down to help people like those in sauri. the author say “we travel town a bumpy road to the village of sauri.” we, could mean two people to several people. but i just don’t think enough people will volunteer.	you’ve heard my opinion on resources, time, and people power. i don’t think we will be able to give help to everyone in our life time. i’m not saying it will never happen, but not for

poverty to help them get out of it.  	the millennium village project helped improve the quality of life in sauri, kenya. in 2004, the millennium village project just started, their plan was to keep people out of poverty. before the millennium village project starts, sauri, kenya was having difficulties. for example, the disease that was very common in africa, was the malaria.  lots of people got the disease from mosquitoes who carry malaria. people would go to hospitals but mose patients did not receive treatment because the hospital didn’t have the treatment or the patient couldn’t afford it. getting rid of malaria was simple but 20,000 kids die from it each day. in 2008, things improved. the hospitals had medicine, and for all of the most common diseases were free of charge. hospitals had water and generated eletricity unlike when the project did not exist. 	kids did not attend school because they had not money, instead they did chores like getting water and wood. the schools would had very little supplies of books, paper and pencils, but the students wanted to learn but it was hard for them to concentrate with out the midday meal. things improved later on, kids went to school for free, schools served lunch for all the students, which made the attendance rate up.	families would be sad with the poor crops they built because of the fertilizer and irrigation they lacked and couldn’t afford. farmers would be worried that they didn’t have enough food to feed the whole family and that their kids would starve and become sick.  with the help of the project, farmers

some reasons why i think that the author thinks that children in the u.s.a should know about how the people lived in kenya before they got halp from the millennium villages project.	my first reason is that chilren should know that those people who live in kenya are poor and that they can’t afford medical care, school for kids, water, electricity, and food. children should know that here in the usa they have almost all of these things. they are lucky they don’t live like the people in kenya. 	my second reason is that the hospital in kenya doesn’t have many medications and in the hospital 3 kids share a bed and 2 adults share a bed and there is lots of patients that would probably not even recieve treatment or others who just can’t afford it. also the hospital doesn’t even have a doctor they only have a clinical officer running the hospital. in the hospital they also didn’t have running water and electricity. also it’s bad how many people that have preventable diseases are near death when they shouldn’t be. the most common disease is malaria and about 20,000 children die from it every day when it can be prevented but they don’t have the medicine. 	my third reason is that most families that farm cant even keep their crops alive because they cannot afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. the families plant seeds time and again but they have a poor outcome because of the lack of fertilizer and water. each year the farmers worry if they have enough food to keep their family healthy. or will the children go hungry and become sick?	now the people in kenya have water and electricity for the hospital children can go to school for free and people can get medicines to help themselves from sickness. also the farmers now have water and fertilizers to grow healthy crops to feed their family. 	those are the reasons why children in the u.s. should read about how kenya has changed with the help of the millennium villages project. children in the us should know that

just 4 years, this common disease and many other common diseases were curable. also, back in 2004, there was no water and electricity running in the hospital. that is not good since water is important. but then, in 2008, there was water connected to the hospital and a generator for electricity in the hospital. before in 2004, bed nets that were to prevents mosquitos with malaria were not owned by many because they were $5 each. but in 2008, every sleeping site in sauri had a bed net. there was much progress in 2008, but that's not all. before when kids went to school, they were always tired after school ended because they didn't have a midday meal. we all need 3 meals a day and having one meal less will damage our body and will make us very tired. but in 2008, sauri had a midday meal for school and the fee for school was a better education. these events that happened in just 4 years proves to me and the world that if you try, you can do it. sauri made so much progress in just

winning the fight against poverty may not happen. i think that because there are too many villages or people in need. poverty is horrible but it’s really hard to make it dissapear. 	first of all, poverty is is nearly impossible to get rid of. i think that because all the villages and people in need. it’s such a big number that is nearly impossible. even if the people have crops and hospitals that acually grow and work poverty will still happen to some people. even if the people of sauri and others have medicine and fertilzer, poverty may still happen. 	secondly, the goal is in 2015 which is in 3 years. probably the millennium village project is also done. and they started in 2004 but in 2008 everything started to be better. since they had fertilizer, water, electricity, cure for diseases, and a working hospital. it’s still a very hard achievement to be accomplish by 2015. if they actually accomplish it i’d be very suprised that that goal would be complete by 2015. but there are other goals to accomplish. there are other goals to accomplish by the time period 2025. 	lastly, it said that in 2008 that kids were attending school because there was more equipment and a midday meal. it said that “attendace rate went way up”. but still poverty is a hard thing to get rid of because all the people who only spend $1 to spend for things they need like food, water, and clothes. also they need bed nets since of mosquitoes which carry malaria and could kill lot of children and adults. so it’s a very hard to deal with. and bed nets cost $5 so it’s hard. so poverty is very hard to get rid out and deal with. 	in conclusion, poverty is nearly impossible to get rid of. and it’s even more hard to deal with. lot’s of people die from no food or no medicine. so i think winning the

dancing and singing. which means that these people are always joyful when they are together, so people can actually help out and also have fun doing it. another example of this is that, people actually think they can accomplish this they just need to help out with this goal. for example in this essay it says that their goal is to get people out of poverty, assure them acess to health, and to stabilize their economy. they can reach this goal if they actually think they can do it and help out. last, i think that this goal might be achievable because villages are supposed to get things

water water to drink. if you have no water, you can’t be clean or do anything like going to the lavatory (bathroom). if you don’t have electricity, you can’t play electronics like cell phones and laptops, but you can use the sun when it comes out in the morning. you should always have bed nets, so bugs won’t bite you at night. getting bug bites can make you sick. in the hospital, you should get more people to help run it or else patients will get really sick. planting and farming is good if you have fertilizer. fertilizer help plants grow faster so people won’t starve to death. kids can go to school if there is no school fee. kids can get smarter by learning in school. school lunches can help speed things up like your parents don’t have to make it in the morning. sometimes parents need to go to work and they can be very busy so they can’t make lunch. i would help them like getting school supplies for them so they can learn peacefully. i would get medicine for them if they get sick or hurt. people from stores should make their store items not so expensive so people from sauri can buy it easier like getting school supplies, food, and what they need. growing or farming is hard work so you should buy food in stores. even though its hard work, it is worth a lot of money because it takes time just to grow a batch of fruits and vegetables. buying food from stores can be sometimes expensive. parents should teach their kids to do chores before they tell them to help, so it could be much more eaiser. one parent should go with their kids and help them with fetching water a wood. parents should also buy like 10 of each supply so it won’t run out so fast. kids should get what they need for school and learn to be a good ledder. it is great that when kids had a few

could not afford expensive suplies to treat their patients then there’s about one-hundred other hospitals that need expensive suplies too that will take a long time to fix. 	another reason why i

also says that people are dying because of disease of malaria. that causes by mosquito bites. a bed net, that has chemicals which last for five year keep mosquitoes away, but it cost $5 each. but how can people afford it? they only live less than $1 a day.	i think that if people work together and make progress, we can make the society more better. like how the people of sauri made an amazing progress in just 4 year from 2004-2008. they established hospitals with free medicine water is provide. they have bed nets and education has also been established. they also provided food and lunches.

would succeed and they can reach their goal. so i believe if people starts working to solve the problems like providing enough housing, foods, and other things that need to be done the next generation or in a few year it will make a big improvement and can be helpful in the future. people will no longer be poor, no person dying out of curable and preventable disease, and having a great and good environment to live in.	setting a goal for somethings and reaching it is a big thing. so if government starts to set goals for the country i believe it would make a huge difference and if people do the right thing like if they don’t waste food and the opportunity to study and the environment better then it would be great especially the technology that they develop this days. they can use the technology to make the work easier. so , if they keep on making things right in the future everything will turns out better. no one is going to be poor if you set a goal better start it now because i know you can achieve it and we all have our lifetime to reach it. you have to strive and work hard for it in order for it to pay off and the more effort you put in, the more great things you’ll

winning the faith against poverty achievable in our life? i think it could be done if everybody saw what a big deal it was and how important it is maybe how it could save thousands of lives. but not many people really care for other countries other than their own. other  people are afraid of being scamned of their money. there was a recent scam of hundreds of thousands of people from a person named russel. he made people believe a man named joseph kony was kidnapping children in uganda and turning them into children soldiers. many people felt sympathy and pity towards them and sent money to the foundation “kony 2012.”	i recently took a trip to vietnam. saigon, specifically. when i was there, i visited my grandmother’s house. she lives in the slums, where i saw many people selling hats, food, and drinks on the streets. many people need shelter and food. just a simple order at kfc can cost up to 200 dong, or 20 usd. there, i saw people selling bed nets for mosquitos, and electric swatters for wasps and bees. i then realized how lucky i was to be able to go to school and have clean air and water. 	i believe achieving faith could not be done because when i was in vietnam, i saw many people walk past homeless people and send them disgusted looks, rather than sympathy. they probably don’t understand that it means a lot to them, and could save them from tuberculosis, a disease very commen in saigon. 	another reason why i don’t think it is acheivable is because each country’s economy is progressivly getting worse and worse. in the us, i see lots of people on the streets everyday without a home or food to eat. people are losing their jobs and don’t have enough money to pay for themselves, or their children. our country and africa are very similar in some ways, many people are in need of shelter and clean water to drink. 	so, is winning the faith against poverty achievable in our life? i think no, because the generation is getting greedier and the economy is going down as well. it would be achievable if more people saw how it could make a difference, but sadly, not everybody does.",1112601Y3_000538643.docx,"yes, the author did convince me

everyone being allowed to have medical care. this will prevent all those people from suffering.	another example is a hunger, another cause of death. we can make that change by giving to people food or seeds that can be grown into food. this will give those who are hungry strength for the day. 	one final example is education, some people can’t afford school so they aren’t educated. we can give those people that privalege by making school free, no fees. that way we will have bright minds running our future.	in conclusion, let me say that there are many more problems than these that must be

of the argument are people who feel that we can win the fight against within our lifetime and people who don’t. this issue is important because half of the people in the world live in poverty. i am with the people who feel that winning the fight against poverty is not achievable in our lifetime.	first of all, winning the fight against poverty within my lifetime isn’t possible because poverty has been a big issue for a very long time. people living in poverty has been happening way before i was born. therefore, it has been happening for more than the lifetime of any person still living. we can’t just do this in less than about 100 years. some people may say that because sauri has made amazing progress in four years, that we can win the fight against poverty. however, sauri is just a small village with a small population, so their argument is invalid.	second of all, we don’t have enough money to help everyone living in poverty. many people have just the right amount of money to live off of. if those people help the people living in poverty, they will be living in poverty, too. the opposing side may say that we will have enough money if the rich people will just chip in. i don’t agree because many wealthier people already give a lot of their money and time to help poorer people.	third of all, i don’t think that winning the fight against poverty within our lifetime is possible because there are too many people that need help. about 50% of the world population lives on less than $2.50 a day. with that many people, it is really hard to meet these goals by 2015 or 2025. others may say that since dramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa, it is possible for poverty to be a thing of the past. i disagree because that is only the villages of a part of africa. there are still more poverty-stricken areas in africa and around the world.	some people may say that if every single person on earth helps in some way, we can win the fight against poverty. i disagree with this point of view because there are people who overtime just to make enough money for their families. also, almost every single person in some way have already helped people in poverty. yet, we aren’t that close to winning the fight against poverty.	in conclusion, i don’t think winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because poverty has been happening for a very long time, we don’t have the money, and there are too many people living in poverty. even though i think that we can’t win the fight against poverty in our lifetime, i

room! compared to kenya, we have a wonderful life. we have cures for so many cures for diseases and other sicknesses.	another reason why i think that the author wants us to know about kenya, is because maybe it will teach us a lesson about conserving. or at least convince us that when we grow up, we will try to help impoverished villages and countries. 	the last reason that i think the

	in the text where the fight for better health says, “the solutions are simple, yet 20,000 kids die from the disease each day.” this is a great example that’s been happening every day in the world. we might be able to save one life but not always everyone. in order to support them we need money too. so fighting against poverty is not achievable. 	other people might think fighting against poverty is possible but in order to do that we needed to give out help. in the text where water, fertilizer, knowledge says, “many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford school fees.” it also says, “the crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation.” it is great to help people but sometimes there is a limited amount of help we can give. the text shows how these people are poor but even if we help them, there are still other people in other places needed help too. so poverty is just a continuing situation. we can’t always provide help and fight against poverty. 	back to my opinion, fighting against poverty is impossible. although, we can still give help to the poor so they can live better. poverty is all over

poverty is when you are poor or having little or no money.  there are a lot of diffrent coutnries and people in proverty.  this issue needs to be recognized because the whole can be driven into it, if the part that can be fixed is not.  in my own opinion, i thing that the fight against poverty can be won.  poverty can happen to anyone.  it doesn’t take much to help those in need of htings that we have.one reason that i think that the fight against poverty can be won, is because we all have had a problem that we overcame.  one example is forclosure.  this is a main start for poverty.  many people’s home have been up for it, and some of the people overcame that situation.  another example is the jobs.  many people have been without a job for a while, so it leaves them in poverty.  now, lots of people have jobs.  one big issue about proverty, is that too many people are in it.  this could of stopped it before it expanded.  we do know that many places were involved in super storm sandie, but they are slowly recovering.  this could happen to proverty.another reason that the fight against poverty can be won, is because we all are a hardworking nation.  one example includes the big san franssisco earthquake.  during that time a lot of the bay areas was impacted.  we all from every place pitched in to help rebuild san francisco.  we all put in some of our own money to rebuild the great city making it what it is today.  it that would work for poverty, then it would be driven away from the world.  a total of 50% of the world lives on $2.50 a day, or less.  if you really thought of it, we all have encountered it.  we got help, which helped us to become who we are today.  the generations are becoming more greedier though, but how could it hurt to donate a little money?one final reason that i think that the fight against poverty can be won because, it is not fair if everyone is enjoying themselves if others are struggling to find food to eat.  if nobody will every help to stop the problem, everyone should be driven into it.  the big problem is that life is not fair.  the answer to that is that every single living person is equal in their own way.some people may say that poverty cannot be fixed, and that the fight against poverty cannot be won.  i respect all those opinions.  i myself would definately disagree with this statement because lots of things have been overcomed already.  the earthquakes in the bay area have already been overcome because we all pitched in, the phsonomea in japan has been overcame as well, because we all worked

increased. children are the future, so if they are getting a good education, the future will be brighter. another reason is that the hunger crisis is being fixed. crops are able to get irrigated, so more food is available to people. 	also, hospitals have better living conditions. before, the hospitals didn’t have any electricity, water, or space. but know patients are given good doctors and medicines. 	my final reason is that all this change has happened in only 4 years. the program has goals that are supposed to be met by 2025. this shows that a lot can be done in a small amount of

help donate some money. if everyone just pitched in a little, it would add up to a lot. like those commercials that are like for children, we can get some like that. maybe like a few cents even a day, it could make a huge difference. some people would donate more, like possibly even $5 a day, if they choose. they can pick their amount.	once a good amount of money is made you could get the supplies they would need for living. like for example getting bed nets, since 20,000 kids die daily. also getting fertilizer would be nice so people could eat. since their crops would grow, the part they don’t eat could help fertilize the soil & keep it healthy. building irrigation systems would also be really helpful to them. they wouldn’t have to travel so far for water.	for school & such, those in africa who are rich, could help possibly pay taxes so children could go to school. that’s basically what they do have so they could maybe do it there. it depends on their government. people here could support individual kids for their school supplies. possibly if they could, pay for their school fee.	so, these are some ways we could end poverty. it’s simple yet so hard but, we can manage. if you

bad the hospitals were. there were three kids a bed and two adults a bed. many patients weren't able to be treated because they were too poor to pay for treatments, or the hospitals didn't have the treatment for the sick patients. in 2008, hospitals had medicine that was free of charge for common diseases, and there was clean water. the people of sauri has made great progress in just four years for hospitals, but hospitals aren't the only things that were improved. 	farming was also improved. in 2004, crops were dying from lack of water and fertilizer. farmers would always worry about whether they would be able to grow enough crops for their families. four years later, the hunger issue was solved. the people of sauri had more fertilizer and seeds, plus tools that would help them maintain their crops. 	in 2004, many kids in sauri didn't go to school. kids didn't have the money to pay for the schools, so they helped with chores. in 2008, many kids went to schools. meals were

another kind of example is about a man that let freedom roam around the world, that man’s name was martin luther king who lived long ago, and fought for his freedom for all races to join together as one and not to be seperated from each other.  so if he could achieve his goal that made a big difference, then other people can.  my last example to how you can achieve any goal is how my school named

our lifetime. i have four ways to convince you, too.	before (in 2004) the city of sauri, kenya. had no heath care treatments or medicines. common diseases killed people every day that could be treated easily to save millions of lives. but no one had the medicines or money. after (in 2008) the city now has free health care, medicine, doctors and healing patients.	in 2004, sauri had zero irrigation systems or electricity for hosipitals or farm land. the crops wouldn’t grow and they didn’t have any water for patients. in 2008 now they have irrigation systems for farmland, to grow crops, and now hospitals have generators and water to look and feed patients.	before, farmers grew small amounts of bad crops. without the nessesary utilities like water and fertilizers, their crops would never become healthy. now the land has plenty of water and fertilizers, so now the crops are growing more efficiently and healthier then before.	finnaly for my last reason to convince you is the education they had. the kids eager to learn, but with small supplies in their inventory. they could not thrive and learn as well as other. with no mid-day meals the kids got distracted on how hungry they were. now the schools have supples to learn, better things, mid-day meals. this increased the attendance a lot. 	through all these sad moments came victory through poverty, there name a solution. a better life came to be in 4 years. now, we know we can make the whole world a better place if we all work together.",4121601Y2_000496659.docx,"yes, the article did convince me because the author says when she came back to sauri, kenya she said it was getting better. the village had more medican and people who are in poverty can now afford a couple of stuff like the “bed net.”	i also think that it won’t be way because in the article the author says “it won’t be a easy task.” i agree with that because many villages are living in poverty, by this project villages in africa won’t be in poverty , have more medican and have water and electricity going through hospital.	people in sauri, kenya are having a better life, before the authour worte that this village hospital did not have any running water or electricity. there was no doctors just a clinical officer running the hospital. kids would run barefoot with tattered clothing.	parents could not afford school for there kids but with the millennium village project kids don’t have to pay for the books or pencils. and have midday meals.",2139691Y2_000489311.docx,why it was a convinceing article because in article part number 2 the fight for better heath because whn people in kenya get belted by a mosquioes. is called malaria is one common disease in africa. that kids can die easily and adults get very sick. and plus they have no doctor’s and no running water and electricity. then there are 3 kids that have to be in on bed together and 2 aduts to be on one bed together. and it the hospital people do not get treatment because the either do not have it or the people’s can not afford the treatment. if they wanet the net it costs dollers but they got less than a $1 dollars. like all the whole familys and kid’s hungry and many kid’s do not get to go to school because they can not afford school. so i think that in our time i think we can help kenya get them all the food and all of the bove and let all the nets and school be free so all the people in kenya will be heath and knowledge when they got to school so we can’ do it in our time.,21342_020012569.docx,"it would take some time, but i think we can win againt poverty in our lifetime. within four years, they were able to have some progress; the fees on schools were dropped and the hospitals had free medicine. these things might seem like it’s

should be stopped because it can be prevented. kids today, they are our future, they need to go to school, become educated. to live.

schools children didn’t have enough of books, pencils, paper. since most children didn’t go to school they were expected to help do chores in the house, get firewood, farm, and many other chores. many people didn’t have lunch, which lead to low energy = sick. if you were sick the hospital provided you with medincine for free yet on the other had they only had medicines for common diseases like malaria caused by mosquitoes’ bites. in kenya bed nets helped prevented bites.	therefore, with the fact of families are poor, without much education, frequently sick/ill you can conclude that to end

doctor, just a clinical officer that managed the entire thing. the patients rarely got better. some of them couldn’t get the medication they need either because the hospital couldn’t provide it or

supplies like books, paper, and pencils, but the students wanted to learn.  all of them worked hard with the few supplies they had.  it was hard for them to concentrate, thought, as there was no midday meal.”  this too is solved: “there are no school fees, and the school now serves lunch for the students.  the attendance rate is way up.”  when farmers’ crops died because the farmers couldn’t afford fertilizer or an irrigation, millenium villages project again came to the rescue: “the hunger crisis has been adressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply.”  when millenium found out that 20,000 kids die from malaria eah day, they made sure that “bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri.”  it is because of millenium villages

treatment they needed. and many of the diseases were easy to treat but the patients didnt get enough or any medicines. another problem was that many people couldnt afford health care so, if they were sick they wouldnt go to the hospital. but then, 4 years later, they (hospitals) had electiricty and water and medicine, for common treatments. 	another improvement, was in sauri's farms. many of the

opinion, africa will never be self-sustainable without help from the u.s. why? based on the natural surroundings of these villages, farming doesn’t look like an option? no fertilizer + little rain = bad crops. same with hospitals. bad conditions + unreasonable fees = 20,000 kids dying a day. as you see, africa, no matter what, cannot sustain themselves without constant foreign help. africa will not recover in our life time, but maybe 200-300 years from now. why such a big number? well, though conditions are improving, africa will never be civilized in such a small time period. within my estimated time, we can make africa into a very close civilization as ours. that is if, and i say if, we can get the whole world to contribute to this massive project. africa has so many people that even the cheapest things can cost a lot. how? cheap item x (big amount) + shipping fees = need of international financial help. imagine shipping medicine. maybe three times the cost. at the end, the u.s. alone cannot support africa constantly nor africa sustain itself, even with the given supplies. well, that’s just my opinion.",41191_020011556.docx,"the author proved that, winning the fight against proverty is achievable in a lifetime, because if the very poor country, in this case, work together, and other people who isn’t as poor helps them, then the poor country is like winning a basket ball game. even if people from other countries give only one dollar a person, that’s one dollar more then how much they have now. also, if people donate food and school supplies and clothes and other good stuff, that could make a huge difference to helping the poor. new or good condiction clothes could replace the tattered clothes the poor children have, some are so poor that the children have no clothes at all, not even shoes! food, such as, beans, tomatos, and other food could help the people from starving to death. their so poor that in a hospital, in one bed, 3 childrens share a bed and 2 adults share a bed, and worst of all there’s not even a real doctor!!! most people there don’t even have enough money to buy a bed net that has chemicals on it, that lasts for five years, that keeps malarial mosquitoes away from sleeping people. the ones that can’t afford bed nets get very sick or even die. 20,000 kids die from the malarial disease each day! and also the poor farmers, their crops get ruined each and everyday, because the farmers can’t afford to pay for fertilizer for the crops, so the crops are not health and the plants die. the farmers now have nothing to sell and nothing to even feed their own families! many kids wasn’t able to attend school, because their parents couldn’t pay for the school fees. in 2004, schools had minimal supplies like paper, pencils, paper, and other materials, but the students still wants to go to school. it was also hard for the kids to concentrate, tough, as there was no midday meal. so donating food, and things to the poor is

did not have ample supplies for the patients who were ill, there was no electricy or running water and there weren't enough beds for everyone. farmers had poor crops and would not provide for the village; let alone themselves.when sachs went back to kenya in 2008 the country's state had improved greatly. for example, sachs said in ""a better life - 2008"", the hospital now has medicine, free of charge"" where it could now provide for and help it's patients properly. she also said that the hospital had running water, and electric generator, and sleeping nets. in schools, they had more students and enough supplies to go around. and lastly, sachs wrote that the hunger crisis had been addressed with fertilizer, seeds and tools to maintain the food supply. in only 4 years, kenya had

save lots of people life but they had a cheap medicine to get rid of malaria. also many kid needed and wanted knowledge but it was hard to get because their parents could not afford shcool fees. and the kid at school didn’t have a minimal of supplies like books, pencils, and parpe and without those things they could’nt learn but they stilled worked hard with the few supplies they had. it was hard

signifigant proggrress in 2008. they have electricity, a hospital and even a good school. but the fact is, this is the exeption to the rule. shure sauri is doing well, but what about all those other countries? there just are not enough people and money to get that to happen in that time frame. these people may want to have this happen, and it will but just not in that amount of time. and the united nations cannot afford to be trying to fix other countries if their own country is flawed. currently the united states are headed for a second recesion and europe isn’t doing very well either. sure sauri might have had a complete change but that took 4 years and a large amount of resources. second of all you have to look at the leaders of these countries. according to the article, the united nations just gives the money to the local leaders and then leaves it to them. but some of these leaders will just spend the money on themselves. he’ll take his girlfriend to paris and buy a new catalac. maybe a bit will gall into the hands of the regular people, but certianly not enough to make a difference. if the united nations wants theese countries to change they’ll have to baby sit them. and babysitting doesn’t pay, in fact it wastes loads of money. and not all theese countries want help. a large amount of theese places are towns in asia and north korea, and kim jong definitely isn’t interested in a little tea party with the u.s. i beleive his exact words were “we don’t want them, we don’t need them!” these dictators are not wilting flowers who are sensitive, their cold hard

that they won’t be able to feed their entire family, this happens every year.also children couldn’t attend school because their parents couldn’t afford it. children usually had to do chores and couldnt learn. but for the children who could attend school it wasnt any better. the schools were lacking school supplies like pencils and paper. but now they have tools for planting food and can now

achievable in my lifetime. she convinced me because of all the progress sauri, kenya has made in four years. also, she is very optimistic about all the goals the millennium villages project is trying to meet.	one reason the author has convinced me is because of how the hospital has improved in just four years. in 2004, there was no running water, no electricity, and three children to a bed and two adults to a bed. also, many of the patients would die because the medication they needed was not available or they couldn’t afford it. in 2008 there now is running water, electricity, and medicine is free of charge, so even if a patient can’t afford that medicine they can still get help. that goal was reached in just four years.	also, now many children attend school. in 2004 there were limited supplies and fees for schools. the fees caused many children not to come to school because their parents couldn’t afford it. also, there was no lunch so kids couldn’t concentrate on their school work. with the help from the millennium villages project in 2008 schools got all the supplies they needed, there is no fee anymore, and lunch is now served. now many kids go to school. another goal was reached in four years. 	another reason i’m convinced is because people aren’t starving. the millennium villags project provided fertilizer so that villagers could grow food for there families. in 2004 people were starving because of lack of fertilizer and water. the author again shows that the goal can be reached in our lifetime.	finally, malaria is now being is prevented. before people got malaria because there were no bed nets. now bednets are provided to prevent malaria. this goal was reached in a short amount of time.	in conclusion i feel that the author truly convinced me that the goal of no poverty can be reached in my lifetime. as you can see all of the changes made in just four years has changed sauri, kenya so much. thing as simple as bednets can help. through all the

get 5 dollars for a bed net that last 5 years. another example of poverty is that their are farmers with no fertilizer to keep their crops a live. also water was low on farmers too that means they couldn't water the plants. now the farmers are worried if there is not enough food for their kids and if the kids get hungry and become sick. the schools were poor too they had only few supplies like books, paper, and pencils but the students wanted to learn. all of those students had work hard with few supplies. their were no midday meal so the kids didn't have energy after school. i think if i

go overt o africa a help. you could just send a little bit of money. 	also, many children are being born into poverty. if everyone has, for example, three children then the problem keep multiplying. you will need more food and more water. for every extra child that goes to school you will need more pencils, paper, and books. many people want to have children or have children. some people have children when they have money, but then lose your money and came into poverty. it’s not just you though it’s your whole family!	another reason is poverty is not just in africa, but in many other countries too. for example poverty is in india, china, mexico, guatamala, and many, many more. plus africa is not a country but a whole continent. how are we going to solve poverty in all those countries (contenents)? 	lastly, that is a lot of money. america has a bad economy now also. who is going to fund this program. it can take years to help just one area/city. with so many countries in

years, i believe that the goal can not be accomplished. i think they goal cannot be accomplished because what you have read in the beginning of project doesn’t show what will happen in the future. just because the four years has shown much improvement, it does not neccessarily create a positive result in the end. as things get better in the area, many things will change, like population, food supply, school attendance, and it will create other problems and concerns. i believe that as time goes on, many problems will come between the project and it will not be as effective as in the four years so far described in the passage.in the passage, the author says that the attendance rate goes way up and the schools are free and have lunch provided. this can be very beneficial, but the problem with this is that with so many people in school, learning, getting paper, books, lunch, and whatever else, the schools would need to find a source to pay for these demands. the kids there are already poor and it is hard for any money to even go through into the community. though, many may pay for these funds from the project, the amount of money is limited and other problems may also arise. another concern that might occur would be the increase of population. as it is written by the author, the yala-sub district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases. because of this, people living there have protection and more food to live and the population increases. because of the increase of population, more resources to sustain a life is demanded, which is hard to give. the district many not be ready enough to sustain a full population with their flimsy amount of resorces that they have. one final problem that may rise in the improvement of sauri, kenya may be government concerns. because of the new changes, the government will need to change and adapt to these new numbers in population/growth/economy/etc. as this goes on, not everything will be positive with changes that may affect the people, harmfully. this change can be very damaging could create a giant problem. overall, i believe that the goal can not be accomplished with the amount of time given. it is possible to get better as in economy-wise and population-wise but i believe that over time, the improvement will slow down, not giving enough time to finish the complete

doctors so that there are more people to help treat people that are sick. we should help get bed nets for these people, so they don’t need to buy it theirself. this can help save people’s life.	we can help farmers get their fertilizer, water and irrigation by just getting it for them. if we do this, they might be able to get it by theirself and feed their family. they can also help feed other families or even the whole village! this will help get better crops for people. farmers won’t be as worried about feeding their families or becoming hungry. student can also get midday meals. 	kids can also get to school if we help them pay. they will learn more and can help their village by working in it. they can get supplies they need. they would also help improve their village by using their knowledge. they will know what to do for their community in the future. 	i think that we can win the fight against poverty. we just need to help these people improve their self. i think they just need more knowledge. i think that we just need to donate and help.",21012_020021051.docx,"in my opinion, winning the fight against poverty is achievable because the millenium village sets goals and each goal benefits the people of sauri. first, they set a goal that decreases the deaths of children by having nets for their beds so mosquitos would not bite the children and get malaria. then they set another goal that helps the yala sub-district hospital. they connected water to the hospital and also generated electricity. third, there was no school fees because more parents could not afford to send their children to school. and i believe that education is very important. the school also served lunch so the children would have enough energy to learn. fourth, they provided fertilizer, seeds, and tools for crops. in that way, families would not starve. all the goals above might be hard to achieve but once you start a goal, the people of sauri will continue it. all you have to do is stick buy them and give them support.",2122501Y2_000466602.docx,yes i think we can win the fight against proverty. well because i think that if evrey one work together then it should all work out. if

to help we could do a funraiser to get some money to buy medicen and school supply for kids. we could also start making changes for kid so thy could have lunch at school and wont be so tired at the end of the day. i also think that thre should be a truck to come there 2 times a week with water for evrey one clean water. also if you see kids or adults that preventily. diseases and you no that you

	one of the three examples that support my answer is in the section named a better life 2008 they say in just four years they overcame poverty. the hospitals have electric generators, also there is no school fee and the school supplies food to the kids. lastly, there is a bed net in every tent. 	my second example is that also in the section named a better life – 2008 it shows the hospital has medicine free of charge. the hunger problem has been treated with fertilizer and seeds. but at first there was some people who weren’t able to get medicine. also each bed net costs $5	my last example

me was because before everyone had to pay 5 dollars for a bed net, but not every sleeping site in sauri. another reason is because before the hospital did not have any medicine, and now has medicine

against poverty is achievable in our lifeime"". i think this because the author, hannah sachs, tells us easy things we can do to help stop poverty. here are three things the author metins in the text.      one thing we (everybody in the world) can do is give donations. the people in sauri, kenya live off of one dollar a day. and, that only covers food. what about water, shelter, and clothing? their clothes are tattered. by donating five dollars you can help the people with their poverty. this is one thing the author mentions.      another thing we can do is help their schools. many kid in sauri do not attend school. this is because of high school fees. like i previously stated the people in sauri live off of one dollar a day. that one dollar is for food. how are they supposed to pay the fees? also, it is hard to focus. the school children don't get lunch. some people say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, well lunch is pretty important too. lunch helps you push through the rest of the day. this is a second hing the author mentions. finally, the autho tells us about the health care in sauri, kenya. in the hospital there was three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. that is not very healthy! what if one of those adults or kids had a contagious disease? then, everybody gets it. there was no doctor! only a clinical officer that ran the hospital. also, there was no running water or power. running water cleans you and hydrates you. there was no power; so how does the hospital take x-rays? these are all things the author mentions to convience me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"".",31101_020021742.docx,i think that we can win the fight between poverty because weth all this techology we can do anything we want

is not any fee. also another example is that school now have lunch for the students. before the schools could not afford it. another is example is that now kids and adults will have a least chance of dieing, because medicine is now free of charge.      i truly think that winning the fight against proverty for sauri, kenya is truly an insperation. some examples why is because this fight against poverty saved so many people lives in sauri. this fight gives people in other states and or countries that are fighting against  proverty some hope. my inspiration from this was because it shows that

think that poverty can be stopped in our lifetime. the reaon why i am convinced that this goal is acheivable is because in 2004, poverty was horible. they had verry little money. people lived off of 1 dollar a day, or sometimes even less. they also didn’t have enough fertilizer for crops, so their crops died faster. many children couldnt even go to school because it was too costly. also many children died because of maleria. (a disease misquetos pass through bites) the reason for this was because they couldnt afford misqueto nets, that prevents maleria. the nets only cost 5 dollars. but due to the coarse of only four years, poverty levels went down. about 80 villages had derastic changes for the better. children could go to school for free. they could get the fertalizer for their plants, and they could get the medicine they needed to treat all of their sicknesses. they also got lunch so they could work better and focus. just think, maybe in four more years, we can do even more for the other villages in sauri. if every four or less years we make better changes, like the first four years, we could make a big change. this means more people out of poverty, better lives, more hope, and happier people.

farmers had more water and fertilizer to grow crops to feed their families. they also had more seeds and the tools needed to maintain their supply of food. “the hunger crisis has been adressed with fertilizer and seeds in the a better life paragraph. the hospital was another improvement in project. water is also now connected to the hospital. there is also an generator for electricity. there are also more medicine to cure the common diease that are free of charge. “hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diease.” “water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity.” this was found on the 2nd and 3rd sentence in “a better life” paragraph.another improvement were the schools. studeents no longer had to pay an fee just to go to school. mid-day meal/lunch has also now been provided for students. “they now serve lunch to the students.” from “a better life” paragraph. there are also more school supplys for the students to use and the attendance rate went up. “there are no school fees and the school now serves lunch to the students.” “the attendance rate is way up.” from “a better life” paragraph. so all together in conclusion, poverty will be gone very soon. the progress shows that the fight of poverty is a chievable in our lifetime. “but sauri’s progress shows us all winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.” “when my kids are my age, i want this kind of poverty to be a thing of history.” from paragraph “a better life”, last few sentences.",31342_020010916.docx,"winning the fight against poverty would be an amazing accomplishment, but we can't do it. poverty is everywhere, and spreading like the plague. the effect on people from poverty is huge and growing. deaths, starvation, education, and money are all issues that hurt everyone, but especially in poverty. it will never fully be gone.	one thing that comes in huge number in poverty is deaths. hannah gave us the information that ""20,000 kids die rfom [malaria] each day."" we could never abolish a disease like malaria in a lifetime. another big factor in poverty is starvation. many people all over the world don't get enough to eat, ""will they harvest enough food to feed the whole family?"" can we fix this gigantic problem in one lifetime?		education is a big problem as well. especially in poverty, nobody can pay for school. it is very hard for a poor child to get to school, ""their parents could not afford school fees."" million of families have this problem, that links to money. money is the main problem of all poverty. but, few people will fund a thing like this because they have their own money issues to deal with. but the harships of others is much greater, ""the people of sauri survived on less than $1 a day."" but not only people from sauri have these issues.	so, i do think that overcoming poverty is not possible. there is way too much of it everywhere. it will never go away. the factors that support my thesis are death, starvation, education, and money issues. destroying poverty is an amazing dream, but there are too many selfish people in the world to ambolish it.",2121502Y3_000519214.docx,"yes the author gave a convincing argument that winning the  fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. i say yes because in the paragraph of ""a better future"" the author  states the goal is to be met in 2015 other targets are set for 2025. another example is in the topic ""a better life"" the example is when she came back to sauri , kenya she noticed they were in better health, like they have a doctor, electricity, water, medicine and more rooms and beds. they also have more fertilizer to grow food like fruits and vegetables for their family. a third example is in the in the topic "" a better life ""it says that dramatic change has occured to over 80 villages across the sub-saharan africa . this change is good because people are getting put of poverty and not making less than 1.00 a day like the author said in the introduction and also the schools got more books, papers, and pencils. they even got a mid-day meal! this is why i am convinced that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.",3112601Y2_000494042.docx,"this article showed us that in just four years dramatic changes can happen. i was convinced that the fight against poverty can be a winning fight and happen in our lifetime. 	my first reason is that when the narrator visited sauri, kenya the hospitals had three children to one bed. the patients were mostly sick with preventable dieseases, they couldnt afford or didnt have the treatment for. but thankfuly, four years later the hospital was giving patients medicine without charge for common dieseases, so less people are dying from extremly prevntable illnesess. 	secondly, when farmers went to plant there crops they didn't have an irrigation system or fertilizer. this lack of needed supplies caused many of there plants to die, which in turn caused many people to go hungry. several years later this has been addressed. the farmers have been given seeds, fertilizers, and other tools needed to keep a food supply. 	my third reason is school. since most people in the united states hav eor are attending school not going may sound fun. but children in sauri couldn't go because their paretns were not able to afford it also, they might have to help with chores such as fetching water. even the children that went only had minimal supplies such as books, paper, and pencils. also there was no lunch so it was had for them to concetrate during school. but with the millennium villages project there are no shcool fees and school provide lunches for the students and the attendance rate has skyrocketed. 	those were my three reasons of why winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. in jus tfour short years many chagnes have been made to help many poverty stricken areas such as sauri, kenya.",41111_020021397.docx,"in my opinion, hannah sachs, who wrote “a brighter future” has conviced me that it is possible to end poverty in africa.

thought it was. before reading the artical i did not believe that we could end poverty in kenya. they have resources such as gold yet the money is not used to improve the lives of their citizens. according to several articals i read online, africa’s government is unstable, resulting in poverty. it also seems that they lack a reliable source of water, which is nessesary for life. i also found it hopeless, because people die from dieseases that are easily preventable, but after reading the artical, i changed my mind.after reading the artical, i realized that i was overthinking. in my brain, i was telling myself that it would take billions of dollars to prevent malaria. apparantly, as the artical stated, five dollar bed nets treated with chemicals are capable of saving the twenty-thousand kids that died of malaria.",31281_020072677.docx,"i think author do not convice me that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.” i have 3 reason for

diseases. there is water and electrity in the hospital too. another example is that since 2004 to 2008, 80 villages across sub-saharan africa had changes and better living styles. my last example shows that the building cost least, for example, there were no more school fees and the medicene for the sickness is free of charge. the battles against proverty takes a long time but works so well because of the progress in africa. the difference between 2004 and 2008 was so huge, it surprised me. people were wearing dirty clothes, people could only use about $1 a day in 2004. in 2008, the city

reason i do believe that if the world works together, winning, the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime. i say this because if the world works together we can win against proverty. one

the world’s help to stop this. however 20,000 kids die from a disease called malaria. we can eventually win against proverty if we work together. we can make donations donating money. the people in sauri are getting sick and dying because of malaria. theres a way to prevent it you can use bed nets. bug them for $5. people in sauri can’t afford bed nets because the lived on less than $1 a day. that meant that they could not afford bed nets. you can also buy cheap medicines. secondly, the children in sauri could not learn because there was limited school supplies. people in sauri could not afford supplies. otherways they could not learn was if there parents could not pay school fees. there lots of records for that. another one was that they had to help out at home. at home they had to help get water and wood. therefore the could not learn at school.also, we can help out in hospitals. we can help out with hospitals by donating money to get medicine. most people in sauri were sick because they can’t afford to see the people to help them. with $1 a day you probably couldn’t afford the cheap medicines. they were just sick and left there too die.so basicly i’m saying that if we work together we can beat proverty. there are many solutions to keep people improvished. the biggest thing is that the whole wide world to work together. it does not take much, but it is not easy. it

money to the poor. second reason there are alot of poor cities or places and it would be difficult to fix or provided things they need. third reason is that people in that community can help or the wealthy to give some of their money to help out.,1139691Y3_000509042.docx,"yes, because in the artical it saids that 4 years went by, and they improved becase they got food for the schooll. they now

have suffered the lack of health care and school supplies. also they have suffered poverty, but i think “winning the fight against poverty” is achievable in this lifetime. and the author convinced me of this.	one way they have suffered poverty is lack of health care before adults and children would get sick from common, preventable diseases, such as malaria which is caused by mosquitoes one way to prevent it is to buy a $5 bed net, but no one does. in hospitals has running water and electricity and medicine, free of charge, for all common diseases. 	another way they have suffered poverty is lack school supplies. children who could go to school did not have money school supplies. some children could not go to school because it cost to much money, so they had to stay home and work. also school did not serve lunch. now schools have no fees and serve a midday meal. 	one final way they have suffered poverty is the farming conditions. families who did farm suffered because their crops would never grow. farmers could not do anything about it because they could not afford fertilizer or irrigation. their families would sometimes go hungry. now farmers have fertilizers so their crops can grow. 	those are some reasons why i agree with the author that “winning the fight against poverty” is possible in this lifetime.",3113501Y2_000487337.docx,"i think we can beat poverty in our

effort, but can be acheived.	in sauri food and healthcare is limited, also like school supplies. sauri must find away to get more money for the people. this will get supplies for schools and beating disease. the only reason for this is to get more jobs. jobs will pay the people and help the economy. if alot of money is gained there will be more supplies to prevent disease. also more jobs will increase food for poor families, and raise money to build more hospitals.	education is very difficult to get. more money will get more supplies for school. hopefully more kids will get educated. education will help kids get jobs. education is key for a strong economy. also education will get kids out of poverty.	water is key for food. i believe sauri can get enough water for crops. soon enough, there will be enough food for families to depend on. unlike in the u.s., sauri's citizens will not take food for granted. they wont waste food which means they wont need as much. like i said, this will take a while. water is becoming scarce so it will take until 2025.	in conclusion, acheiving the fight against poverty will take a lot of work but can be done. with a limited amount of water

couldn’t afford school fees or they had to help around the family. but it wsn’t any better for the students. the school had a minimum amount of supplies so they ahd to share supplies. also, the school did give any lunch. this made students have no energy at the end of the day. this was harsh for all kids because they didn’t have as much opporonities as us. then 4 years later, things got better. school now gave lunch to kids. there are no schools feel so family can afford it. the attendence rate had went up. this showed how anythign can be possible. now they have better opportunities. anotehr example is in paragraph 4. it state that the condiions of the local hospital.in the hospital, theere was no running water or electricity. patients had to share beds and couldn’t afford medicine if there was any. then 4 years later things got better. medicine was free and water was abundult. also electricity was avaliable. now the people can be cured. this showed me that anything was possible. the last example that definetly convinced me was the farming crisis in paragraph 7. it stated that farmers had to work to plant and grow crop sonly to get little or no satisfaction. there were no fertilizers and lack of water, which crops needed. so they get a low amount of income. this made farmers worrya bout their families if they can feed them or not. than 4 birght years later, light struck. each farmer could afford fertilizer, water was abundant. also they had seeds to plant and tools. they had gotten a good amount of food supplies. by this information i learned that you can

that people and children are dying because they can not afford treatment.  this reminds me of when the earthquake in haiti happened.  people all over the world were trying to help save everyone there

should help them on the last stretch of their journey, to give them the nessesary materials to have as much money as an average american. there are many examples how we can help them. 	first of all, they need to live a healthy life. life in most places can be harsh, with a common disease or a virus spread from a certain area. this can be like in afria, where malaria is spread from mosquitoes. although the price to buy bed nets is very cheap, most people in many places have nothing to sell for money, and in poverty, you might usually have less than a dollar a day to live on. a quote to prove this is in the section “the fight for better health” stating, “each net costs $5.	second of all, places need food and water. many places might not have clean irragation and fertilizers to grow food. this is simple, yet places might have drought, and even have to live off some compost like orange peels. kenya in example has bad irragation and crops. in example, a quote would be, “their crops were dying because they could not afford the nessasary fertilizer and irragation.”	lastly, people need more education and knowledge. education is hard to get, as there are school fees and not all people have money. at home, kids did many chores, and had no time to be taught. people also did not know all the ways that people live easier, ways to make things better, and shortcuts to things. this makes life hard to live, with no ways and no time to do things in the little time you have. we could teach these kids, and it wouldn’t hurt to give them money.	all in all, people all over the world can besaved. this just takes us to give them a bit of money, and supplies. this simple way of giving to people can save thousands of lives.",31301_020052209.docx,"yes, the author did convince me that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime,” because the author said that patients didn’t recieve treatment either because the hospital didn’t have it  an patients couldn’t

couldn’t afferd school because of the fees, and in school it was hard to concentrate because there was no midday meal. but all that changed in four years, the hospital had medicine and free of charge, for all common disease, they had water, and electricity. they had fertilizer, seeds, and tools, there were no school fees and there were midday meals. all this made me think that if we start preventing proverty as the same age as the author then the sooner we start, the more people we could help. so i think that “winning the fight against proverty is achieveable in our lifetime.”",3112501Y3_000528817.docx,"it did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable because even though it wasn't everywhere, they were able to get rid of poverty. in just 4 years 80 villages across sub-saharan africa, extinct poverty. so that proves the millennium project worked, in the fight against poverty. also it proves you can do it in a lifetime because you are still alive after 4 years. another thing it proves is that you could destroy proverty in alot of places in a lifetime because if they helped the same amount of villages in 4 years, that's 20 villages, 80/4=20. if we could do than same about every year, then maybe in a few hundred years, we could abolish poverty everywhere.      also another that had convince me was that no matter how bad condition the village was, the millennium project could fix it. for example that villiage in the story, sauri, kenya, it was in really bad condition. there was alot of sick people, but they couldn't be cured because they didn't have money to pay for treatment. plus they could have stopped themselves from getting sick, but they didn't have enough money to buy things to prevent sickness. people in sauri, kenya only made money, which was usually less that $1 dollar a day and it was usually spent on food, so they couldn't buy anything else. also familys were so poor kids didn't go to school and they would have to stay home to help with chores. besides that, the schools didn't provide lunches, and didn't have much school suplies, by the end of the day all the children were tired and worn out. also, the farm life wasn't that great there, crops didn't grow well, farmers there couldn't afford the right amount of irrigation or fertilizers for the plants. so the plants would usual wither. as you can see, this villiage had horrible conditions, but the millenium viliage project fixed it up and now people can go to school, have good food, don't get sick often, and make alot more money, and they were able to fix it up in a few years.       as you can see no matter how bad it looks and even if it lookes hopeless, fighting against poverty is achieveable in a liftime. also it proves the milienium village project can save villiages no matter how bad the conditions are. people were able save 80 villiages in less than a centry, and you usually live longer than that. those reasons i listed is the reason why it conviced me that you can fight proverty in a lifetime. i also think that maybe in a decade or 2, even though thats a not a life time or you might not live to be a hundred

for health is that i was explaining in the 3rd pharagraph but i bade a mistake on not descreding it. so once the author visit the hospital she felts scared and sad, maybe becuase she think people dervese not to die at that young of a age.	the irrigation's for the farmers was not working out for them becuase they didn't have the supplies for the crops and what are the farmer's sopose to

medicane or papers and pencils. i think most of it is based on if other people work together. if every person in california donated a dollar, dozens of villages can be saved from poverty. but as

were better. in 2004, the hospital had no electricity and water that is connected to the hospital. people could not afford medical treatment and medicine. also there was only a clinical officer running the hospital.the farmers crops were dying because they don't have enough money to afford fertilizer and irrigation. a family have very little crops to eat because of the lack of fertilizer

quote just cause the way they put the words seems challenging.	one example is that when sauri didn't have enough school supplis or medicine and fertilizer they had to find a way of acheiving that goal by working hard. they set the goal of having enough of those needs in 2015-2025.	the 2nd exmple is that when they had the disease malarai. in order to no get that disease they had to buy bed nets. however the problem was that bed nets were expensive. the bed nets were $5, and their budget wasn't that high. so then 20,000 kids that have malaria die from it.	the 3rd example is that farmers didn't have much crops because they couldn't afford necessary fertilizer and irragation. what that caused was people didn't have much food to eat. the farmers worry are they going to harvest enough food to feed the whole family. and will their kids go hungry and die. many kids in sauri didn't attend school because their parents couldn't afford the school fees. the schools had minimal supply of books, paper, and pencils. it was hard for them to concentrate because they had noting to eat during the day so the were tired at the end of the day	in conclusion, in 2008 sauri improved a lot. they had medicine at the hospital which is free. bed nets were used in every sleeping area. they had enough fertilizer and irragation to feed their family. there is no school fees and their is lunch.

days, many people are poverty and poor. so thats why they don’t have enough money to afford the things that kids do need. however, i think people would not be so poverty and poor, if they work

electricity. “there are no school fees, and the school now serves lunch for the students” in 2004, schools had minimal supplies and so midday meal. it was really hard for students to concentrate and they had no more energy. “the hunger crises has been adressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as tools needed to maintain the food supply” in 2004, the farmer’s crops were dying because they can’t afford the neccessary fertilizer and irrigation. they have and outcome of poor crops because of the lack of fertilization and wateri think the millennium project in sauri, kenya really made a change

of all, there has already been massive changes in sauri, kenya. for instance, in the yala sub-district hospital, there used to be poor living conditions. there were few beds, little medicine, and no running water or electricity. malaria was often constructed by people. farmers didn’t have much fertilizer or water, so irrigation wasn’t easy. plus, few children went to school, because of high fees and no mid-day meals. all of that has changed in four years. the hospital has been improved. every sleeping site has bed nets, lowering the chances of contracting malaria. irrigation is practiced more.  attendance rates at schools have increased, and mid-day meals are now served. 	second of all, many people are trying to help the people of sauri. millenium villages is improving lives. the united nations also are helping. people from all over the globe are helping sauri, kenya. 	finally, there are multiple solutions to poverty in sauri. some have been attempted. bednets, more medicine,

money so that children could have lunch.  when the kids was trying to learn they couldn’t because they was so very hungry.  all the kids in the school really wanted to learn.  some other problems that people in kenya had was that there was flies, and when you are sleep they would come out.  so the people had put nets on their beds so that the bugs wouldn’t bite them but it wouldn’t only last for five years, and the nets cost $5, and the adults only made $1 dollar a day because they didn’t have enough money.  in 2004 there was not electricity, and no nurses when people was in the hospital

doctors. also, the schools had almost no supplies to begin with by they recieved textbooks, pencils, and lunches. the attendance rate is much higher. in sauri, the farmers crops would die because they

africa?another peice of evidence that africa will not heal in our lifetime is when mrs. sachs comments “this task will not be an easy one.”  that is very true, which just helps the view of africa not healing in our lifetime.  if healing africa is hard and there is a lot to do, how will africa get healed in the current generation?  the answer to that is africa will not get healed.  the reason for this is not to be negative.  it is simply just stating hte obvious.  as finnick odair quoted, “once you gall, it takes ten times longer to get back up.”  and, if one connect that very true quote to africa’s situation, you will figure out that it is impossible to heal africa in the current generation’s lifetime.",1139691Y3_000512008.docx,"yes,  because kenya made it possible for curing the

day. sauri hospitals could not support their patients, either because they didn't have the treatment, or the patient couldn't afford it. many people suffered from malaria a disease that is preventable, but because many people could not afford the proper treatment they died.	also many kids in sauri couldn't attend school because their parents could not afford school fees. kids who were able to attend left without energy because sauri school couldn't provide a midday meal for their students. school supplies were minimal like books, paper, and pencils. students came to school ready to learn and working hard with few supplies.	many families grew sick from starvation. many crops didn't perish because of lack of fertilizer and water. farmers would plant seeds hoping for a new outcome only to have to same outcome. many farmers worried about the outcome of their families lives.	then in 2008 sauri, kenya made a change the yala-sub-district hospital has medicine, free of

mosquitos. and there’s bed nets in kenya. each bed net cost $5 and bed nets keep out mosquitos that carry malaria. it says that a bed net can save millions of the life’s this could help everywhere.	third, it say’s that in the hospital kids and adults have to shrare beds. also it says that people cant afford medicines for their family. this is very very sad. if we all do some thing they could get what they need to live.	these are the reason’s they convinced me if we all do something to change peoples life. this goal can be achieved if we all try. if kenyawas helped why cant everyone be helped. all the problem can be helped. if we all try.",21432_020009173.docx,"after reading this article, i am convinced that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.  i am convinced of this because in the beginning of the article, the author was writing about all the common problems, such as hunger, thirst, and malaria.  however, to conclude the article, the author was explaining how villages across sub-saharan africa were experiencing dramatic changes.  medicine is now in hospitals at no cost.  malaria and other diseases can be treated, resulting in a longer lifetime and a lower deathrate.  the occupants of the villages now have water and electricity, as well.  the farmers are also supplied with fertilizer, an object they were lacking four years back.  based on these changes (that took only four years) i am very convinced that it is possible to win the fight against poverty within our lifetime.",31072_020022924.docx,"yes the author did

hospitals they got medicane for all paients, water, and a genarator for electricty. at first sauri was a not to good place, people live on street selling thing for money, not many kids were able to go to school because of fee and there was no lunch for them either. farmers couldn’t grow crops because they needed ferterlizer, they worried crops would die and there families would starve. now hospitals have medicanes for sick paitents and got water running in the hospital and a generator so they have electricity. sauri had a great chang so children get an education, more people can live

hospitals. all this has happened since 2008.	another way that the author convinced me is that bed nets can be used to prevent death and or sickness. one way bed nets can be used is for preventing malaria. it is good to prevent malaria because it can prevent kids from dying. malaria can also get adults seriously sick. now every household uses bed nets. 	the last way the author convinced me is that children couldn’t go to school. children couldn’t go to school because their parents couldn’t pay for the expenses. another reason children couldn’t go to school is because they had limited supplies. now all children go to school at no cost at all. 	now that all of these problems have been solved we can do other things to improve kenya. i believe that we can definently help kenya. the

possible. based on the text, after four years, sauri had changed to not having enough food, to having enough. from poor education to good education. from poor health to good health. it showed us that we can win in the fight against poverty. in a specific area. but to say we can stop poverty from the world, that sounds pretty much impossible in this lifetime. sauri was free from poverty because of

the author is trying to help people out of poverty, and it’s a good thing helping people out of something that’s really hard for them. (its like, treat others, the way you want them to treat you.) and the author really help them out of poverty because now the people of sauri, kenya had a better life than 2004.	my second reason is that the author helping people from diseases. many kids die in 2004 because the malaria disease. they don’t have a bed net, so mosquitos bite them and brings the disease. but in 2008, many families have a bed net, and less people die from a disease. 	my third reason is that the author is trying to help hospital, schools and planting. in 2004 there’s change for hospital, and there was no medicine at all, schools don’t have enough supplies and no school lunch, and crops are starting to die/dry and they don’t have enough food for the family. but in 2008, everything change. schools have

beds, no medicine to treat the patients, no doctors to take care of the patients to prerent it we can donate. to not get malaria is bed nets that can’t have mosquitos batting you. another thing is tools becaise instead of a shovel they had to use there hands. the food can’t grow cause no money and no money means no fertilizer or irrigation. no food means nothing to eat for the three meals a day. the schools won’t have any food becaise of no fertilizer or irrigation. there are less school supplies. some kids don’t go to school because of fees parent can’t pay, and because sone kids do chores. what is kenya like now is good because hannah sachs donated alot of money. she donated money for water electricity for the hospital, more beds for patients, medicne, beds nets (lots),

donate we would be helping the schools take better care and let the students learn what they need to know. i say this because in the text it say that the schools didn’t have many supplies for the students to learn with. 	also we can help by donating money. if we donate money then it would help in many ways. one way is that since the people in sauri didn’t have enough money to pay for medication or the malaria disease. since the text said that some children die of the malaria disease becaus of no medication. another way to prevent malaria is to help buy bed nets using the money we donated. 	lastly we could help by giving them water. giving water would mean a lot to the sauri people. in the text it said that they did not have enough water to grow there crops. if they didn’t have enough water to grow their crops then they would have enough water to drink from. 	so now i see that many people can be suffering from poverty everyday. so i think that if we do all the things

can definitly win. mosquitoes carry malaria at night and when they bite someone they have to go to the hospital. there’s no point in going to the hospital because there aren’t enough docters to much patients that are all crambed in one room, and patients have to share beds. 	winning the fight against poverty could help children with education, bigger schools, more supplies. we could also have better hospitals and more docters to take care of patients. there are three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed and the hospital is always packed with patients, and there aren’t enough docters.	some people might say that they dont think we could win the fight against poverty because more and more people become greeder and greeder each day. i disagree with statement because once everyone sees how important this is and they think about they people who die giving birth, dont have clean water, and enough medicine, and how grateful we are that we have clean water, that we can walk and that we have medicine they should be donating money and if they aren’t they are selfish people. i think winning the fight against poverty because if everyone donates money and helps out then

had no running water. the most important thing that they didnt have are doctors/nurses. the people were near death when they shouldnt have to be. this is one reason that the author convinced me. they wouldnt have made it without this project.	another reason is that when the farmers were running out of crops, they were saved. the did not have the neccerrary fertilizer and irrigation. they had seeds, but the outcome would be the same. the crops would always die because of not having the neccerrary fertilizer and irrigation. farmers were worried about this. will they ever feed their family

afford bed nets in 2004 and it said that in 2008 all the people had bed nets. in the story it said that the millennium villages project also gave them school lunches for the kids because they din’t have hope. another example shows that winnining the fight against poverty is achievable is that in 2004 the hospitals din’t have no water and in 2008 the hospitals did have water. also a way we can

can protect mosquito bites by using bed net, which they cost five dollar, but it was too expensive for people who lived in kenya. but four years later, people in kenya are able to use bed nets.

fighting against poverty. i think it is difficult to change, but i think poverty is achievable in our lifetime.	another example is in the section called “water, fertilizer, knowledge”. people in

have a fees to let kids to attend school. the kids in kenya wanted to learn but they didn’t have money. but four years later, they were able to get fertilizer and water. also there are no school fees

had. and, at the end of the day they had no energy because the school didn’t serve lunch. now children can go to school, and have lunch. 	another example, why the author convinced me, was that farmers were given the tools, and fertilizer they need to grow crops, and harvest them. now lots of people can feed their family because their crops were beginning to produce more food than before. so, that they can feed their families to give them energy to work, and to sell some of their crops to earn money. 	the last reason, the author convinced me with, was that people caught malary because they could not afford the net which protected them from mosquitos at night. that was one common way people caught malaria, but some people could not afford it. even the cheap medicine some people couldn’t afford. even when they took the victims to the hospital they were not treated because they could not be tended because it was too expensive. now every sleeping sight has mosquito nets and the

attending school, they don’t have to pay for it so it’s very helpful to the childrens families that are in poverty. they also serves lunch @ the school, and they have the tools for the crops so that

important for poor people.	now, many people beg for money on the streets. they didn’t even try to get a job. if they did, their life will become much better than now. for example, the text showed “the school had minimal supplies like books, paper pencils, but the students wanted to learn. all of them worked hard with few supplies they had.” it tells us that although students lack of many things, but they still worked hard and they tried. that also brought them success. if the homeless people try to fight over their poorness, maybe they will become successful too. they can go to public school to learn more education and get a job. 	parents always want children to get good education. my parents worked very hard to get our whole family to immigrate from china to here san francisco.

didn’t have the supplies to keep them from diying. there died line is in 2015 and they don’t have enough time. so goals the mvp hoped to reach after the four years is to change poverty, get better healthcare, get a better economy, and try to get better lifes in sauri. so ways i think the people from the mvp could get help is to try getting more people from the united states to help donate money to the people in sauri because they only make $1 dollar a day. if they have more people in their family that will not be enough to feed them. some things they need to improve on is getting farmers the supplies they need to keep their crops alive, another thing they need to improve on is cutting schools fee for children to go to school because they need their education. after the four years of the mvp in 2008. hospitals got medicine, free of charge, for all common diease including malaria. hospitals also got electricity and running water. everybody in sauri got free bed nets. farmers got

hospitals with water, electricity and medecines that can cure many diseases. they also have schools that have free fees and lunch also supplies to help them learn.	they also gave bed nets to every sleeping sites to prevent mosquitos from bitting them. they also gave water, fertilizer and things that they need to farm. almost everything with the problems that they face in kenya is solved. only 4 years has been passed and maybe in the next couple of years more and more people could help for the project.	it is also possible that the project could be done before 2015 or 2025 if enough people are generous enough to help them and also maybe to do another project in the different parts of the world so that poverty will be only a history to the world. we could help this project by donating  food, water, fertilizer, supplies or money to those people who are in need. being a part of the project could help not only one but tons of people who really need our help.	peoplein kenya made their place better just by planting,having water, free hospital fees also school fees because they studied and they could even get a better job than just doing chores and maybe if they also see people in need they would help them too because they already experienced how hard it is to be in poverty. having free fees at school makes people be more excited to go to school and ready to learn. having people medecines for them for free could help them live longer than other people used to live before the project has started. bed nets are one of the most very important thing that the project has provided because malaria is one of the most deadly diseas that is carried by a mosquito that could kill sometimes thousands or maybe millions of kids and adults that can’t afford the bed nets. water and fertilizers are a big help for them because now they could farm and give extra food for the school and have enough food for their families.	these things are only some common things that they have

is achievable in our lifetime. looking back at 2004 hospitals didn’t have electricity or water, the 2 basic thing you need for a hospital. the funny thing is there is no doctors only a clinical officer. and the place is filled with dying people and childrens because of disease. i think they should just give out free net so there are fewer people who dies instead of 20,000 each day.	sauri, is a very dirty place with people selling bananas on the streets. if you want poverty i stop i think they should start cleaning up tame place so it’ll look more fresh that people/tourist will come

money. but i suspect that is not going much use for much longer. there will be a time when people will stop helping sauri because shipping things back & forth from u.s to africa cost money, it’s not

kids go to school with no school fee's, school lunch, and a good/better education. second, the yala sub-district hospital was in bad shape because it had kids with 3 patients in a bed and for adults 2 to a bed, there were many patients sick that couldnt get the medicine because the hospital didnt have it, or people couldnt afford it. now, the hospital is free of charge of medicine, there is now running water, doctors, and electricity for the patients who were al sick. third, many people caught a disease from mosquitos called ""malaria"". you can get this when mosquitos bite you. its preventable but many people dont have the proper care to get rid of the mosquitos, which is bed nets for $5 each. many kids die and many adults get very sick. now, every pearson in each sleeping site has bed nets in sauri, kenya which prevents that dangerous disease. last, one main problem in sauri is the irragration and fertalization. the farmers worry if the plants will grow because there is not enough water or fertalizer. now, there is proper seeds and fertalizers to feed everyone who needs food. just in 4 years (2004-2008) they made a huge difference in thosands of lives which makes me and

progress in sauri, kenya in a before and after format i could really see what the millennium villages project does for villages like sauri. i believe that fertilizer and water are the most important things to help improvished communities worldwide. 	the main reason that i was convinced that poverty will be history by the next generation is the way the facts were presented. the arguments were presented by first describing sauri as the project first began. next, she described the project, its goals, and the plan. finally she showed the positive effects of the millennium villages project. this format was convincing because it showed progress, while showing what more can be done for people living in poverty.	another aspect of the essay that was very convincing was ways that we can help people in villages like sauri. an example of this would be, “each net costs $5, the solution is simple, yet 20,000 kids die from the disease each day.” this shows how we can help, and the devasting effects of not having a net. by showing the effects of poverty through disease, the author lets people know that we too can help in the fight against poverty.	what made the essay interesting was the narrative format. instead of stating facts and what we could do, she told us how she had seen sauri. this was much more persuasive than stating facts. by showing the effects of poverty on children she made the reader feel very empathetic. by showing a typical day in schools she showed connections between farmers and education. in her words, “the people of sauri made amazing progress in just four years.” she showed the positive effects of fertilizer on learning. 	this essay was very persuasive because she showed positive effects instead of only how sauri could be further helped. she also wrote in a narrative, before and after format, which describes the progress to someone who hasn’t seen sauri’s progress firsthand. by showing how we can help people in poverty, she made us feel less helpless while giving clear suggestions of how to help. all in all i think hannah sachs is a very convincing author.",4112601Y3_100280534.docx,"i think it is achievable: they have already made

and isn’t as poverty strickena s it was before the millennium vilalges project began. 	in 2004, when hannah first went to kenya, the hosptials were a mess. there wasn’t any running water or enough medicine. there weren’t a lot of hospital beds, so people had to share bed (three kids to one bed and two adults to one bed) they didn’t have any medicine, for even the cureable diseases. there wasn’t even a real doctor just a clinical officer running the hospital. many people wer egetting sicka nd dying form preventable diseases. 4 years later, tehre is running water. peopl can now have there own hospital beds. they have medicine for preventable diseases now. they also have an actual doctor now. all that happened in just 4 years. 	in 2004, many children didn’t go to school. there was a fee to get in and many parents couldn’t afford to pay. instead of the kids going to school they did work, sucha s getting wood and water for there familys. the kids that did go to school didn’t even get such a good education. they didn’t have enough paper, penciels, notebooks, or school books to learn. but kids were so determined to learn, they didn’t care that they didn’t have nough supplies to elarn. they worked with what they ahd. to make matters worse, tehre wasn’t any lunch,so by the time the kdis went home, they were worn out. bu nowdays, the, kids can all come to school, because it is now free. the kdis now get lunch and enough supplies. they can now get a proper education. 	there was a lot of people living in poverty andhtey can’t afford food for the family. these families often survived on one dollar a day. they didn’t have lots of food to eat and some didn’t even have a roof to cover there heads. newer days, people at least have a roof to cover there heads and enough food for three meals a day. there isn’t as much peole living in poverty ast ehre was before the millenium village project. 	there is one problem i left out about the old kenya, the farming! farmers. there was no special fertilizers that hey used in america. the was no equitments that we haved. kenya has the equator line that runs right thorugh kenya so it was very dry. that means no water for the plants. now days, its still dry in kenya, but they have enough water to plant the plants. they now have fertilizers and the fancy machines that we have in america. in a course of just four years, the country ahs went from a dangerous place to a homely place to live.",4131501Y2_000501548.docx,"there are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished. we walked over to see the

that 100 people are not in one class they also need better books and make school free for the people of kenya.they should start their own foundation like red cross or the hati foundation to donate money for the things they need.	i think the usa wont help unless they give the usa something thats why we might not happen.the usa wont help kenya africa unless it benifis us or they give us money

my oppinion the author did not persuade me on stating that ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime"". reasons why i belive that the author didn't give good statement is because hannah the author suggests the possibility of what could happen if the community works together instead of actually bringing people together to make a difference.	furthermore i also disagree with the suggestion that ""fighting against proverty is acheivable in our lifetime"" such as the authors states because the writter explains that over yala sub-district hospital in the year of ""2004"" they visited and she informs people herself that ""i'ts hard for me to see people with preventable disease"". my question is why have people in africa not tryed to fight the disease of malaria wich whom malerida could be prevented but still has not	finally i conclued my opinion by stating that the author herself states that this process would be complicated but has ability's and disabilities that it would not be possible because many of the diseas are not able to cure.",11262_020033377.docx,"if you think that we could for poverty read this.i think that you could stop poverty because africa turned it around when mostly all of the people were poor.  the people in africa only spent $1 a day they couldn’t get anything for $1.in 4 years they really changed it around.  if we could do what they did almost everybody will a lot more money, and a better life.  i really think that we could change poverty around because a state that was a lot more poor than us changed poverty around in just four years.  we have more money than them so we should make a big change faster than them.if we try and do they something like what africa did, and if we could do it we would do really good.  also since we have more than them we could do more better.i think we could change poverty because some how you would find a way like what africa did.",11052_020012779.docx,"i think that this is very possible. if first world countries were to help more, it could definitely happen. in america, $5 is not a lot of money. i’m sure that if each person could donate $20, people who need bed nets would have plenty of them. this would help very many people and prevent them from getting malaria. also, in america, people can be very wasteful with food. instead of waiting for something to go bad, it would be better to donate it. i think this would help stop world hunger. but also, water is a natural resource. i do not believe that people have a right to control it, nor do they have a right to make others pay for it. if everyone had enough water, we could make more farms and more food, helping to stop world hunger. education is another very important thing. all children should have access to a good and free school. if children don’t know how to read, how will they function well in life? all schools should have enough supplies and textbooks for children to learn from. education should not to limited to only those with enough money to go. these are a lot of easy things that could make “winning the fight against poverty” possible.",41331_020023765.docx,"peek_020023765	i don’t think “the war on poverty” is acheivable in our lifetime but it maybe acheivable in our childrens lifetime. i think a more realistic thing the author could have said is “winning the war on poverty in kenya is acheivable in our lifetime. i don’t know if  the author thought that in our lifetime the world will see no poverty or if it was just a poor choice of words. in my opinion, if somebody wanted to get rid of poverty we would have to do step by step and do the little things first, like what the millennium villages did i believe we can get rid of poverty in kenya in our lifetime but we can’t get rid of poverty all over the world in our lifetime.	lets say you were born in 2004 which was when the author was first brought to sauri. by 2025 you would be 21 and hopefully the people of sauri would not live in poverty. but think about it, it took 21 years for that to happen and  believe it or not there are country’s and cities worse off then sauri. lets say you live to

secand suppot for my answer is that in 2004 people had a hunger crisis, and the kids din't go to school. kids din't go to school because the could not aforet. people had a hunge crisis because farmers could not aford the water, and with no water plants could not live or grow. in 2008 this people help farmer get water and the gave the see, and toals. kids went to schoold because they word free. the

question that they can not do the same with other countrys and villages. an example is how they made the hospital a lot better by giving them water sourse and electricity. which not just help the poverty problem but the number ohs will decreass also. one really important example is the bed nets. without bed nets more people need to go to the hospital and more will die. the last example is how

just four years. but they got help from other rich countries that are willing to help. they have almost everything that they need. sauri is one of the villages that people have helped. 	my second

conflicts between communities, the project would have failed because they can’t move forward. 	one example is in 2008, the yala sub-district hospital recieved medicines. then the hospital had medicines that are free of charge. this must have really helped thousands of people from common diseases because many people still only had a dollar a day. additionaly , the hospital got a water and electricity supply which is really important because water is neccesary to live. 	another example is when the project gave each person a bet net to avoid malaria. just by the nets, many people were saved while 20,000 kids died in the past by malaria.	lasty a achievement is that the project provided each child the ability to learn in school with no fees. this should have made people knowlegable

she went back to sauri in 2008 that “bed nets were used in every sleeping site.” if this can happen in one village, it can happen in every village. further more, in 2008, there were “no school fees... the attendence rate was way up.” once these students grow up with an education and they have kids it will influence their kids to go to school. this may go on for generation after generation. finally the hospitals “had medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases.” this convinces the reader that once people are cured of their disease they may go on to do many other things. for example, go back to school, then get a job and have a happy life. 	“if every village is like sauri and can make as much progress as sauri than we will become very successful. sauri is just the start

2012, we have already helped 80 villages across sub-saharan africa.	how, you might think. well, when the author first visited sauri in 2004, she said this about the yala sub-district hospital: “it was not in good shape….the rooms were packed with patients who probably could not recieve treatment, either because the hospital did not have it, or patients could not afford it….there was no doctor….there was no running water or electricity.” but in 2008, the yala sub-district hospital has free medicine, for most of the common diseases, water, and electricity. it’s amazing how much we can do in such a short amount of time.	in 2004, when hannah went to visit the farmers, their crops were dying; they had no fertilizer and water. “every once in a while, the farmers would plant seeds, only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of fertilizer and water.” every year, farmers would worry about not having enough to feed their family, and if their children starve and get sick. in 2008, things started looking better, people gave fertilizer and seeds and tools to help maintain the food supply.	“many kids in sauri did not attend school…” why? well, one, because their parents probably could not afford the school fee, and, two, because there were very little supplies, and, three, because there was no midday meal; students would have no more energy at the end of the day. now, in sauri, there are no school fees, and the school provides lunch. now, lots more kids attend school in sauri.	malaria was also a problem in sauri. some mosquitos carry malaria, and when you are bitten by one, if you are an adult, you would get very sick; if you are a child, you can die from it easily. there are a few solutions for malaria, but most people probably couldn’t afford it. one solution was bed nets. bed nets are treated with special chemicals that keep mosquitoes away. but bed nets cost $5 each, and the people living in sauri at that time were living on less than $1 a day. there were also some cheap medicines to cure malaria. now, in every sleeping site in sauri, there are bed nets to keep mosquitoes away, so they wouldn’t get malaria. 	those are only but 3 reasons why we can make sauri a better, poverty free place. and with everybody’s help, we can all help kenya!",4132501Y2_000512372.docx,"yes, because there is 80 villages in saharan africa where they have made it where kids at school get lunches everyday now. there is no fee for going to school. there is no money you have to pay for the hospital. there is runing water and electricity for hospitals. the author convinced me that winning the fight aganst poverty is achievable in our lifetime.",2112601Y1_000383898.docx,"“changes for the better”	in the united states, most kids wake up early five days a week to go to school. you pack all of books and take a heavy bookbag to school. after school you come home and grab a quick snack before you watch television or start using any if not every electronic device. but that’s not how things work everywhere in the world. in places like sauri, kenya most children wake up early everyday, but not to go school; they clean and cook for their family. if they’re lucky they might get one meal. it’s important for children in the u.s to be aware of what happens in poor countries so that they can be grateful and try to help. this is what a twelve year old girl who is part of the millennium villages project thinks. 	the author of this article wants to change the world one step at a time. she goes to places like sauri and helps. when she sees the hospitals in sauri that have 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed she knows it’s not fair. especially since there is no doctor, just a clinical officer running the hospital. there are many patients in the waiting room who won’t get treatment because the hospital doesn’t have it or the patient can’t afford it. most of them have preventable diseases but will still die from it because of the poor hospital. but five years later, after some help from the millennium villages project, there are treatments for common diseases more beds, and it’s free. kids should be aware of that. 	farmers in sauri could hardely grow enough food for family due to lack of fertilizer and irrigation. now, after some help, there are fertilizers and seed available there are also tools needed for farming. now that children can be fed and can be treated for diseases they can go to school. but school isn’t how it used to be; no midday meal and parents can’t afford it. now school is free and has lunches. there are also more school supplies. it’s important to know things like this. 	kid in the united states should be aware of the change going on around them. even if it doesn’t affect them. they should be aware of how lucky they are because what they consider normal is very high-class compared to other places. they should be aware so that they can have the opportunity to help. i think the author agrees with me.",41302_020028813.docx,"i think it is their are able to kill poverty because even in 4 years it is possible to make a big change like having running water, free medicen, and having light in hospitals, and the disesie in that place that kill 2,000 kids in a day is not preventable and cureable. that is why i think it is possible.",21092_020030508.docx,yes. the author convince me because the people in africa need a better life. so they won't die without food or shelter. and they need money to feed their family. an example is that many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford school fees. because they were really poor and they earned $1 a day just to feed their family. and if they saved their money for school they will all die by hunfer. and when they get sick they can't afford medicines or they don't have a good doctor and they can die.,21171_020031345.docx,"the author has convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is possible in our lifetime because 80 villages are already making progress. i think that many other villages will have help and not be impoverished again. also sauri has made a lot of progress already, so other villages can be helped too.	another example is that the people of sauri made a lot of progress in just four years, so that proves other places in africa can be helped. the farmers of sauri already have more fertilizer and irrigation so they will have enough food and crops to feed their families. if people in the world worked together to provide water and fertilizer for these farmers, starvation can be prevented. 	i also think that other places can have lunches at schools if people would donate money to pay for them. kid can think better if they have lunches. 	another reason is that a lot of people suffer from diseases that can be prevented. the world should provide medicine that can treat these diseases.",3128601Y2_000575055.docx,"i would say that the author did convince me that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable, in our lifetime because i think that if we try we will succeed, what i mean is if people start donating things like food, beverages, clean, uncontaminated water, clothing, medecines, money, shelters, and hospit. children that want tobe in school cant even go to school and kids that are in school have to walk 2-5 miles just to get their and they have little school supplies like books, writing utensils and paper and the children who would do anything to get an education get little or none at all. the hospital care is poor there is usually two adults to a bed and 3 kids to a bed. i think we can donate things like bread to fill them and clean water and things like misquito sorry because the levels of malaria is getting really high especially and not and tropical areas. we can also donate seeds to grow tomatos, lettuce, greens corn and more grains, also donating fertilizer because when they try to grow plants they die because there is nomoney for good fertilization. i think it would be good if people who sign up for millinium villages project should at least $2 dollars a day to help towards providing food, treatments and clean water.",21212_020022678.docx,"having read this i have formed an oppinon. i believe that it is quit pissiable to fix the entire world, but in a date past 2025. one reason i think this is because when the author traveled to keny ait was a mess. school fees were to expensive for any one to actually pay, there was little water, and there were three kids to a bed in a hosbitale. and four years later it was much better, but still needed work. if it takes four-six years to fix one small village, it will take at least 10-100x time till we are done. but once we fix, we aren't done. villages, once in a while will need to be repaired. plus if they recieve 1$ income daily, they need more jobs so it's hard then it sounds.	not only will they need more jobs, but villages that are in such wild and poor states as such will also need more hospitals. but if we do that we should also send medicine to them. because as the author stated where people would go to the hospital they might no get treated because either they couldn't afford it, or the hospital didn't have the right treatment. not only could they get sick, but they could also get attacked by a hippo, crocodile, or other wild creatures. so hospitals and income are important, in places like kenya. and it will take years to help these problems in only one village. imagine how long in would take in 300 villages!	i have heard that some villages are'nt as ahead in history as us. some villages still have dirty water, or no toilets. it would take a while to make sure all villages have clean wwater, good fertalizer, and actual toilets. but it is important to do so because dirty water can sicken and kill people, and having no fertilizer will slow down how well and quickly your crop grows. i bet that some days people don't get fed. and if we are to help, it will take years to fix this. an example of this was in kenya where they don't have enough fertilizer.",31431_020009270.docx,"yes, she convinced me because she did so much work thru out her life time because she took that goal from a young age and she has been acomplishing it. also because she knows what she wanted/wants and she is putting her heart and mind into it to get a sprout out of it. the reason why she convinced me is because she does it for the kids more than for herself. but mostly because she impoverished the land so more people can live, grow crops for food/vegetation. as well so the kids can live happily. what also convinced me was her quote “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.” the reason why this convinced me was because throw out her lifetime she has got something out of it to make that sprout to turn into a tree and everytime she does something good that tree gives her fruit to eat so she wont starve. not just because of that also, she is doing what she enjoys best that is helping the people that are in need because they don’t have anything to eat sometimes, don’t have an education. they might not even have food or a roof to live on so they are always walking around naked or barefoot around the street. but mostly because they are millions of people out there that we don’t know and are dieing of hunger, dieseases, coldness, or maybe even of love because they don’t have any parents/family. but as well as food clothes and shelter, the people there are grateful for anything they can possibly get that we are not. so this really convinced me because it talks about how we can help other people but we just don’t care or say we don’t have time even thow we really do. this also inspired me to help when i can and i should do it to help people in need, because the need more things than what we have here in america",11181_020015293.docx,i thinked it is achievable if

single doctor there too. so, the patients weren’t getting treated. it was either because the hospital didn’t have it or the patients couldn’t afford it. also, about 20,000 kids die of a disease called malaria that come from mosquito bites. people can prevent this disease from a bednet buy they cost $5. also, mosquitoes come out at nighttime, so they’d really help. she also said that farmer couldn’t grow crops because they’d die of no fertilizer and water. next, she said that the schools charged fees. that caused many kids that couldn’t afford school to not get education. but all of this changed in 4 years in the year of 2008. almost every place in sauri now had bednets. the schools didn’t charge fees anymore, and now they had water and fertilizer to grow crops. in the hospital, they now have

kenya.	secondly farmers now have needed suplies. they now have suplies such as fertilizer and seeds. without those, everyday they worries about not having enough food to help their family eat. they now hav food with lots of nutrition that can feed their family. farmers may even be able to share their extra food. this is great for keeping pople healthy and not poor.	lastly, schools ave greatly improved. earlier, attendence was very small for a number of reasons. families couldn't afford school fees and children were needed to gether food and water. also, there were very limited supplies and their was no lunch. with out lunch it was hard to study which affected how students performed. currently, we have all those supplies and there are no fees. 	when all of these reasons i mentioned work together. i think fighting poverty is possible. all those improvement were in 2008. now it is 2012; imagine how much the millennium village project helped now. all in all, i think it is possible that the millennium village project well vastly improve the poverty of kenya in our lifetime.",4106501Y2_000509320.docx,"yes, because she was 12 when she went and 12 isn’t to far from 10. i know when

of sauri seem very motivated. they know their town/village is struggling, but they want to try their hardest to make their lives easier and more enjoyable. according to the article, the people of sauri thought of solutions and are doing much better now. they did not just think about it; they actually took action. it took about four years to solve some of their major issues. for example, kids were not able to go to school in 2004 because there was a fee, but as of 2008, there is no fee. schools are free. already kids and other people are getting a better education. another example of a reason why this problem can be solved in our lifetime is people from outside africa, the united states of america, are being very generous and donating. sauri also decided that hospitals would be free to people with common diseases like malaria. as said in the article, malaria is very easy to prevent; all you need are bed nets which cost $5 dollars. the people in sauri in 2004 were not able to pay that amount. however, i am pretty sure that people have donated mosquito nets and due to those donations, the malaria rate is going down. the people who are living in this time are very able to donate things like mosquito nets. they just need a little push to take action. in the direction sauri is headed, i am sure they will be able to succeed in their fight to lessen poverty rates in their

“winning the fight aganist poverty is achievable in our lifetime”. an example that supports my answer is that in the article “malaria” is a common disease in africa, which is from mosquitoes, but in the article it says “malaria” is preventable, and treatable. so all we need to do is just help, so then thosands of lives can be saved. people can just donate a little money to send some medicine so then many lives can be saved. so there is hope, and a very good chance we can win the fight aganist poverty. 	another example which supports my answer too the fight aganist poverty is that its true that people living in poverty (africa) have no money and food, and are wearing tattered clothes, but we (people) can solve this problem. also my support to this statement is that in many places around

anymore then people in poverty can have a better, and greater life. then all can go well with people in poverty in (kenya, africa) with all the things people send, or donate. 	one last example which supports my answer too the article is that in the article children or kids in africa in poverty don’t have a education, or can’t afford school fees. so people can just send some books or pencils too

sauri are in poverty. according to the story the author provided evidence that we can win the fight against poverty in our lifetime. in 2004 there where 3 kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. i feel that the rooms were packed with patients who probably would not receive treatment. because the hospital did not have or afford it or there were no doctor, only a clinical officer. malaria is one disease common. kids can die from it easyly and adults get very sick. bed nets could save million of lives from malaria. their crops were dying because they necessary fertitlzer. many kids did not attend school because they could not afford school fees. the schools had minial supplies like books, paper and pencils. there were no midday meals, the children didn't have any enery becaus x they were hungry. in 2008 the people of sauri had made amazing progress in just 4 years. hospitail has medicine, free of charge for all of the most common disease. water is connected to the hospital. whic

hannah sachs said “the goals are suppose to be met by 2015. the goal is already half way done. they achived most of by 4 years and its not even close to 2015 the author said “they was 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed.” the mosquitoes their carry malaria and most of the people their cannot afford a net to protect them from bugs. and they can catch malaria the people cannot afford nets so thats

this is pretty self explanitory. all across poor regions in africa this is happening. if we know, then we can help. when.	this knowledge of other people inspires thought and inspiration. now! is

happens to millions of people a year. when you imagine a situation that is similar you really feel terrible about who it is happening to. if we help other countries we will save lives.how...	to solve this problem we need to honestly only donate a few dallors from each city in the usa. these few dallors add up to thousands. spending only 5 dallors can buy a chemical treated bed net will stop a child from being bitten by any moisquitoes. just one moisquitoe can infect a person with malaria. this disease is a parasite that kills up to 20,000 children a day. this life saving net has chemicals that will allow it to last a few years! in other words five dallors can save a life.an example of change.if you don’t think that saving these people is possible, then think about these people. there are about 100 villages in kenya who used to be as i drescribed in the earlier paragraphs. though after almost a decade these villages have simple medice for most common diseases, running

because she is using some of her money to buy bed nets and trying to get enough money to buy medicines for hospitals. she said that she would get medicines to cure a disease called malaria. malaria is a disease caused by mosquitoes that usually fly around at night. she went to some schools and saw that they don’t get lunch and some children get sick from not eating. the farmers plant as many crops as they can so that they can feed their whole family and sometimes they worry that they don’t have enough fertilizer and soil to grow crops for their families. when she went to see the hospital she realized that their were no lights or electricity. so she couldn’t see the inside of it to explore it. another problem with the hospital is that there is only one clinic officer running the hospital and their were no doctors . dramatic changes have have occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. the progress is encouraging  to supporters of the millennium villages project. there are many solutions to problems that keep people impoverished. what it will really take is for the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good. it will not be an easy task. but sauri’s progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime.,21251_020011985.docx,"in my opinion, the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable. my reasons for this opinion are that the water problem can easily be solved, generators can be built if there is little or no electricity, and supplies can be bought cheaply.	if water is hard to obtain, then an irrigation system can easily be made. growing crops would be har to do if there was no water. hospitals or clinics would be hard to do if there was no water. hospitals or clinics would need water to wash their hands so that diseases wouldn't spread as easily. if there is no water for people, then living would be very difficult.	in many acres of the world, there is little or no electricity to use. this problem can easily be solved by using things like solar panels to generate electricity. using solar panels in placed with a lot of sun would be great, because the sunnier it is, the more electricity can be produced. electricity can help in places like schools or in hospitals so that learning or treating people would be easier.		many problems in poverty-stricken areas are because of lack of supplies. these supplies can be bought and distributed easily. for example, a mosquitoe net could be brough for $5 and medicines for malaria can be bought cheaply. lack of food could be caused by not enough fertilizer, which also could be bought cheaply. if we could buy supplies cheaply, then why can't we help others who need it.",11081_020019994.docx,"yes this author convince me about putting people out of poverty because the millennium villages project in sauri, kenya are trying to help the people of sauri by sending

common diseases in africa. second, every sleeping sites now have bed nets to prevent mosquitoes from spreading malaria. third, the hunger crisis were solved by the un providing the village water, fertilizers, and even tools for growing and maintaining crops. lastly, since school are now free and kids gets lunch too, attendance rate went up. now, a lot of kids go to school. i think the

the government should provide more healthcare thats cheaper so people dont have to pay so much for their family members not to die. i also think they should create shelters that help homeless people

that if it took four years for a village in africa to get medicine, then it takes time and to me there are to many places with poverty to be able to acheive.  i believe that if enough people try and commit themselves then maybe we can get close but no matter what there will always be poverty in the world.     another reason is bringing fertilizer, medicine and school supplies takes money.  people there don’t have the money to buy it so the foundation will have to find money elsewhere so that people can have those minimal supplies.  finding money also takes time.  people there might be

a convincing article. the athour wrote this article to help people to fight against poverty in kenya. the athour start a project to fight against poverty, the project is called millennium villages

first day she went to the hospital and she said it wasn't in good shape, three kids to one bed and two aduts. the rooms were pack with patients who probably wouldn't recieve treatment. there was no doctors, only a clinical officier running the hospital, there is no running water or electrity. kenya need better hospital, so no more lives would be gone.      people in kenya get sick every day, like in the text 20,000 kid die every day because this disease called malaria, it is common in africa. and each net cost $5 and people in kenya get less than a dollar a day. so they could be protect. kenya need more money.      people in kenya barley even eat because the crops were dying, they didn't have the right fertilizer and irrigation. each farmer was worried that the crops wont grow so they can't feed there family. kids were very hungry and even got sick. and many kids didn't get there education because there parnets couldn't afford for school.      i think the twelve year old girl did wrote a connvincing article. she connvice me to help the kids in sauri because they can't get food, education they need, and the hospital. the more we help the people in sauri, they would

2015 i think their will be many more goals to be set in a lifetime that may included getting more kids in schools and getting bed nets for everyone. the inpiration of telling us many children can not go to school because of their inability to pay and how about 20,000 children died each day or they can not grow their own crops. hearing about these stories lets us known that we can prevent these events from happening. when you have a bed net it can stop the spead of milaria in africa. fertilizer can help them grow their own food to eat. we can also try to start funds for kids who can go to school. also the progress that was made in the few four years drives people to keep the progess to continue.	with the medicine at the hospital which they have for most of the common diseases. also

because it says that the people of sauri have made very good progress in just four years. that means that if they did that in only 4 years they can achieve alot more in the other years. another example that can support my answer is when it said ""dramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa."" that means that they are achieving alot of progress because the changes have happened already in 80 villages. in the story it also says that the progress has been encouraging the helpers or supporter of the millennium villages to keep going and to not give up. that explains that if its encouraging them more they will keep working hard to make kenya a better place that it used to be. the progress is good because it tells them that anything can be possible. the progress is also good of people dying of hunger, thirst, and diseases each day. the next sentence that i think can help my answer is the one that says ""what it will really take is for the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good."" this sentence means that if everyone comes together they can achieve their goal, it wont be easy unless they work hard, together, and be

sauri have a little money that’s poverty. my opinion is to make poverty to stop and help or get everyone in the world to help or work together. now sauri made a different to some people life so can we if every one put there mind to the task we can make a different to like sauri. for example if sauri came together with people and mad them stronger she just did impoverished. the fight for better

free medicines that treat more “common diseases.” the hospital also gets water and has a generator that generates electricity. and, school is free and provides lunch! all sleeping sites have bed nets that keep away malaria infected mosquitoes. and, to banish the hunger that inhabitants of sauri face, the millenium development goals provided them with fertilizer, seeds, and utilities to make sure their food supply is stable. yes, i think that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime,” because the author is probably only about twenty. so she has a long time left here. unless she gets into an accident.",3132501Y3_000535066.docx,"yes the author cinvinced me  in the secson ""a better life "" it said that in 4 years they did fix the hosidly , the schools and people have bed net's  every sleeping place. so  i think they can make sauri kenya a better place in 2015 or 2025. in the lasted sentence  in ""a better life"" they said ""achievable in a lifetime"".",1126501Y3_000533117.docx,"the author did convince  me that we can win the fight against poverty because if the millennium villages project can make a difference in sauri in 4 years then we all can make a difference in the entire country of kenya or in the entire continent of africa in 9 or 10 years. the author also convinced me that we can win the fight against poverty because she said that there were small things we can do like give $5 to buy a bednet, donate medicine, or give gardening tools that could save thousands of lives. finally, the author convinced me that we can win the fight against poverty because she was 12 years old and she made a huge difference. this shows that no matter how old you are you can make a difference.",3118591Y2_000520402.docx,"no, i think that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime, because a lot of people won't try to come help and to supply money and water for the rest of their lives. i think some people might not help, because they might complain about mosquito bites, and the weather, because kenya is close to the equator, so it will be vert hot there. if 20,000 kids die each day, and they try to help them, in a week it will be more 100,000 kids dying in kenya each week. if kenya wants to become more successful, then they will need more helpers. they need a lot more helpers because they only earn less than a dollar a day. they also need medicines, but it will take them a long time for the people in kenya to save up to 5 dollars. the author did not convince me because 20,000 kids die each year, people in kenya earn less that an dollar a day, many kids can't attend school, and they don't have enough money to get fertilizer. so, if more people help they can unite together to form a team so, it they don't set more goals and acheive it by 2025, it will be a lot of poverty around kenya and it will probaly be more than 30,000 kids dying each day. the helpers can't be there everyday when kids die, so if they don't get enough shelter, water, food, and hospitals, some children might not make it to their twenty's. if the children moms and dads made it to an old age, the kids should, too. all they have to do, is to use the same strategies back in the day (i don't know what the strategy is) to survive longer and healthier.",2131502Y2_000495075.docx,i believe that it’s achievable because the more people that join the better it’s gonna be. when people give money they will have bednet’s and they will be better when they have more money they will use money they could buy ferilizer for crops and will have more food. now malaria has a cure by 2015 it will be achivieble. if people start helping it will by succesful.,1118501Y1_100022662.docx,"i think the aurthor thinks its important for us to learn about kenya to show us how we can change the world and what the effect would be like. the millennium villages were poor and didnt have enough money to pay for medicine, to get fertilizer for crops to eat, and for schools. over 20,000 kids died a day because of the proverty in kenya. the hospitals didnt have water, electricity or doctors. the kids had to share a bed. there was three kids to a bed, and two adults to a bed. when the project ended kenya had medicines for the hospital the kids were able to go to school, they had food because they now had fertilizer for their crops. now kenyas kids are starting to feel better now that they have medicine for when they get sick.",3118501Y1_000466471.docx,"if kids learn how kids live in bad places, they might be thankful and want to help others to make a change. some of the changes are they got water, electricity, and medicine at the hospital. at school kids got more supplies and got a hot meal everyday. also farmers got the fertilizer and supplies to plant food. all of this happened with the kids helping others and caring.",2106502Y2_000443612.docx,"i firmly beleive that kenya should had gotten more help. the reason for me stating this is because, the people of kenya got what they wanted, but the thing that they didn’t, were shoes. also, i think that the govermnrment should have gave them more money in the first place. in my opinion, i think that people should have made a strong repelent for house, and not just the bed i think that the reason why the misquitos keep coming in, is because, they don’t know a way to stop them. but overall what they had done to make kenya a better place, i think that they did a great job with the inprovement in kenya. in my opinion, the title states that kenya is making life better there.the evidence in the text shows that the people of kenya wants to have more growth in the year of 2015. at the time when kenya did not have alot of books for school, i didn’t think it was good because, when children don’t have enough book to learn, they won’t a really good education as they should. but in 2008 everything inproved because at first, kenya would drink from unsafe water, and now kenya drinks from safe and clean water well. also, at first kenya did not have as much hospital beds, and know they have enough money to get new hospital beds, and know they have enough money to get new hospital beds, and they do. and now kenya has enough books, and now they can get a real education. also, kenya could not get food during school because they couldn’t aford it, but only the lucky ones would get lunch, and the children would only get water while learning, but now they have enough food for every child inschool.the town of kenya has become better and better througout the years. but kenya is hoping to reach their goal in 2015. from whats been happening througout the years, i truely think that kenya is going to reach their goal. do you think that kenya is going reach their goal? in the article, it states that kenya has changed througout the year.in 2004, we followed the village leaders into yala sub-district hospital. it was not in good shape. there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. also, during 2004, the hospital had no electricity and they had no medicine. but in 2008, the hospital became better, now in 2008, the hospital now had electricity and more medcine to treat patients in the hospital. also, they got more hospital beds so people would not have to share hospital beds. dramatic changes had ecoured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. the progress is encouraging to supporters of the millennium villages project. i feel this way because i know that everybody could pitch in and give someone a better life in kenya.",4112601Y1_000468720.docx,"kenya: before and after	i think that it is important for kids in the united states to learn about how life was like in kenya before the project. so does the author but i’ll explain it with 3 examples. 	my first reason is that kids did not get a free education. since the parents of most of the kids could not afford the school fees, the kids could not get an education. by the way, the schools had minimal supplies and there were no midday meals so the children would come home with no energy and an empty belly. but because of the millenium villages project, kids could have a free education, a midday meal, and more supplies. 	my second reason is that there were a lack of good health and sanitation. there had to be 3 kids to 1 bed and 2 adults to 1 bed in a hospital, plus, nobody could afford the fees. also, there was no running water or electricity and there was no doctor but a clinical officer. the millenium villages project changed everything because water was connected to the hospital, there was a generator for electricity, and medicine was free. 	my third and last reason is that there was a lack of water, fertilizer and seeds. when they planted the seeds, they would have no water or fertilizer for the plants which unfortunetly made the crops die. which mean that there would be no food for the family to eat and made them starve. the millenium villages project however, gave the farmers fertilizers, seeds, and tools.	as you can see, the millenium villages changed the lives of many kenyan people such as free education, better health, and better farming.",31041_020028232.docx,"when will poverty be enend? when the goverment feel like it the money ad the poverty to do something and they want to use all there money on the

waisted, hospitals shouldn’t be expinceive. if someone needs help what are they just supposed to die? that’s not right. 	therefor i believe we can win the fight against poverty. i respect how she made it to were schools have things they need and no fees. also how there are bed nets at every sleeping site. my question is how did she get all that stuff over there? so my answer is yes, she convinced me.",21412_020073356.docx,"in my essay, i will talk about the life in kenya, africa and how i think this place would be more a better place for everyone to live in. 	in 2004, kenyas’ hospital doesn’t have electricity and water. they have 2 adults in 1 bed and they didn’t have any doctors only a clinical officer. poverty people will lead them to the cheaper hospitals. in 2008, everything in hospital was better. they had water connects to the hospital and a generator for electricity. they had enough bed for everyone. 	malaria is a common disease in africa. it came from mosquitos. when mosquitos bites you, there’s a 75% chance that you could have a malaria. 85% of kids die from the disease each day, then the adults get sick. crops were a problem in africa too. farmers thinks that they didn’t any fertilizers to make the crops grow faster. they didn’t have much bed nets for everyone, it costs $5 each. although in 2008, about 65% or kids didn’t die from the disease, because of the medicines. also they were more crops in the farm. and number of bed nets increased. 	in 2004, education was a huge problem for everyone. 75% kids didn’t get to study, because of the fact that their parents couldn’t afford it. some kids go to school but it was horrible. they didn’t have much materials and kids doesn’t have lunch. other kids help their parents to get more money by working at really young age. in 2008, schools were free, they had the exact amount of the materials and they have lunch every single day. 	in my conclusion, i would like to point out that i think the percent of impoverished will increase every year, just because of the fact that many people nowadays help the poverty.",3129501Y3_000507727.docx,"the oathor can go down there and see it if it is good to live there. it is har winning the figh to do it. the outhor make me feel good for knowing about unknown country in africa. the outhor say “the year was 2004, i had ever been to sauri”

houses burn, because when they made food it go to the grass, so their hous and market are made with grass. at last they began to made better life in 2008. i don’t know who did that but, their free

part-ially convinced that poverty can become history. there are many reasons why i say this. since sauri was in poverty in 2004, i knew that sooner or later, sauri would be in better shape.in 2004, suri was “the sick land.” in the hospital the author went to, in her words, “on that day in 2004, we followed the village leaders into yala subdistrict hospital. it was not in good shape.” the author goes on about all the sad, disturbing things she saw. 4 years later, all the hospital’s problems were fixed. then sauri had virtually zero water (as being in a desert), zero fertilizer (couldn’t afford), and zero knowledge (no cash.) as the author says, “time and again, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of fertilzer and water.” the millenium villages project raised funds, so later on, education and crops flourished. finally, in 2008, “the people of sauri have made amazing progress over the last four years.”",3112601Y3_000509588.docx,"yes the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"" because even though she did mention a lot of things that are not good sauri it is good that she did that so that people know what is going there. another reason she convince me was because she adressed that there is a foundation helpling. also since some things were fixed by 2008 i am positive more will be fixed by 2015. finally if everybody find out about the problems they will start donating. however i do think it is a problem that america a country that had a big part in helping is going through a depression and it might be hard but we will win the ""fight against proverty"".",1128601Y1_000517804.docx,"i think that its important for kids in the

down there and save their lives then from 2004 to 2010 they would have still been, hungry and poor.	now in kenya they have food, houses, and they also has a hospital that has medicine and now they can pay their medical insurance. for an example “today hospital has medicine, free, of charge, for all the most common diseases.",11352_020022256.docx,"is winning the fight against poverty achievable in our lifetime? 1.2 billion people live on less than a dollar a day? this is important because many people are going into poverty. i think it can’t be done because there are just too many people that need help.	one reason i think this is because the hospitals are in bad shape. there are 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults per bed. there is no doctor, running water, or electricity. all of that costs a lot of money. some people may say that villages will get those things in the plan. but i think there are too many people to help and treat throughout the world.	another reason is the farmers crops are dying. they can’t afford necessary fertilizer and irrigation. they may not have enough money to feed their family. some may counter and say with the water we’ll give them, they’ll be able to grow their crops. but i say that everything costs money and with everyone in poverty, it’s gonna cost a lot.	one more reason is kids can’t go to school because their parents can’t afford it. the school’s also have minimal school supplies, no lunch, and it’s hard to concentrate. some may say with food and water, their parents won’t have to keep them home and they’ll be able to go to school. but i say that there is many kids not in school and it again adds up to more money. we’ll have to donate tons of money.	again some people might say that the plan will solve everything. but there is just way too many people to help.	so i think it can’t be done because hospitals are in bad shape, farmer’s crops are dying, and kids can’t afford to go to school. there is too many things to fix in each town

or bed nets. those things would help a lot. many people won’t suffer that way. they wouldn’t lose their loved ones.	do you want a job? you would need education if you want a job. a lot of kids in sauri wanted education but they had a few supplies. education would help a lot in the future. you would learn how to read and read and write. you can get a good job and earn more than one dollar. if you have more money, you can afford more things and wouldn’t go poor. education would be a really good use.",2134501Y3_000496026.docx,"yes, because the patients in the hospital are spreading

to help with health care, learning, and food & water. poverty can be taken away from kenya eaisily if we amend these things. first, we start with health. you know how you dont die of common cold or the flu? well, in kenya many do die of it. but the answers simple. we could give people in kenya simple preventers or killers of disease. also, the ""deadly killer"" malaria can be prevented with mosquito nets that cost 5$! second, we need to help with tutelage. many kids don't go to school because of fees. so then most kids dont ge tthe knowledge they need. also if they did go to school there was no miday meal. but now they have no fees for school. also they serve free lunch! finally we need to work on the food and water problem. the people in kenya live with mainly no fresh water. they have th eocean vut dont know how to change it ot fresh water. also farmers dont have irrigaton or fertilirers to produce plentiful crop. now 6 years later they ahve good irrigaton and fertilizers for food. also they ahve more seed and better tools. so, from all this poverty will lower fast because farmers can feed their family and sell lots of crops for money. now kids will learn more and go to school more. and now th epeople that are sick in kenya can be treated. so all poverty there will be banished.",2127501Y1_000478390.docx,"i think kids in the united states should learn about how life was like in kenya before and after the millenuim villages project because it lets kids know that people in other countries don’t have the same opportunities that americans have, but these countries can be helped. there was a place in africa called sauri, kenya. in sauri there were some major problems. for example most kdis in africa can’t go to school because parents can’t pay school fees, but the one’s that do go don’t have lunch. in america almost every kid goes to school and schools serve lunch. in the hospitals there weren’t enough beds, no electricity or running water, no treatment and no doctors. in america patients get the treatment they need. americans can even get medication from drugstores, some people don’t even need to go to the hospital to get treatment. one disease that sauri had a problem with was malaria. malaria was out of control. people get malaria from mosquitos who bite them. people can’t get malaria if they have bed nets. bed nets only cost five dollars, but most people can’t afford bed nets. when adults get malaria they just get sick. when kids get malaria they can die. many people can afford bed nets in america. in america we don’t have a big problem with malaria like sauri does. these problems have been solved. for schools the mellenuim village project have made school fees. free and schools serve lunches now. for hospitals the treatment is free of charge and electricity generators and water are connected to the hospital. for that malaria problem the millenium villages project has gotten the people of sauri, kenya bed nets.

attendance rates have gone up. there has been a huge improvement from how it was before. if there were more who knew about it, people would want to help. if more change like that happens then it can become a place without poverty. 	another reason on why i think this is that not many know about this. if there were more people, it’ would be better. if others from around the world had knowledge about it, there could be more change. if many more people had awareness of this, some people may help them in there current state. 	i also think that if the goverment lent a hand, not only will they not be poverty. if more important people helped, it will be known. then our problem of poverty would end.	in conclusion, the war against poverty can be won. there has been a great change. if there

homes, schools, and hospitals.since the millennium village started to help people in kenya many things are being accomplished in order to get people out of poverty. one of their achivements is that the millennium villages has improved hospitals and schools by giving better lunches and by giving people the attention they need. many schools in kenya have been given supplies for students. this will help children with their studies because they will have materials to use and they will be able to learn what they need. also, their will be no school fee's for the kids in kenya. this is perfect because many kids will no be looking for wood and something to eat. not having to pay school fee's allows children to go to school and to learn. when the kids had to pay school fee's, they didn't go to school because they could not afford it. many hospitals have been improved too. now, hospitals have water and electricity to keep the hospital running. also, the hospitals have medicins for the patients. this helps because now people have an opportunity to stay alive and to be in a good enviorment. another thing that is helping are the bed nets that everyone have. now mosquitos don't bite them and they can be healthy. if everyone helps the millennium village, kenya won't be in poverty and every will have what they need. poverty will be illimanated in kenya y 2015 or

its 2012 now and end 2015 they should be halfway finished. only 3 more years left. they are trying to provide water and electricity so the sauri villages can have a better life, and healthier life. in

become to a end. in 2025 they are working to reach other goals. we have no heard anything about the 2025 goals. i hope the people of africa will not live in poverty anymore. 	i hope the best for the

as the time goes by people of sauri, kenya most likely will be impoverished. these are my reasons why.	the reason why i believe we can win the fight against poverty in sauri, kenya is because the city has been through so much struggle dealing with medicine and health. most people in sauri barely have any money to spare for food. there are diseases such as malaria which can be caught easily from mosquitoes. this disease doesn't help when you have hospital beds filled with three children and another with two adults. or when you can't afford $5 for an bed net.	also knowledge and education plays a big part in the city. most schools have school fees that you have to pay just to attend. most children do not attend just because parents can't afford the fees. also due to minimal supplies, students don't have very much to work with. energy to stay focus is hard with no midday meal.	as fours years later comes, the people of sauri made magnificent progress. the hospital has many medicine to provide, without any hospital fees. also bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. and for education, sauri has no school fees and provides lunch for each student. more children are not attending school.	to conclude my essay i would like to announce that the article did persuade me and gave me knowledge on sauri, kenya. also i do think its possible for sauri to

children and to provide food for them at school. but in 2004 there were a lot of struggles and troubles that i read in the paragraphs. tattered clothing, no energy after school, people in hospitals suffering from illnesses. but eversince 2008, things have been going perfectly because sauri got food, electricity, water. i;m actually glad that sauri got everything they needed to have a good and healthy life that they have now. poverty is a bad thing to me and i am against it im just happy they got better things in their hospitals so people won’t die. and the bed net can prevent mosquito’s from biting people so they won’t get the disease called malaria. and poverty is achievable in our lives because if we work hard to end poverty there will be less poor people in countries and more people would have homes and food and money. and why we should do it is because most countries don’t have running water and electricity, most hospitals aren’t working, children don’t get to have the education they want and need, the crops and plants aren’t growing so well which are making people starve in saui, kenya and in other countries. poverty is in a lot of places and they need help including money, they need working water and electricity. they need more clothes. but it got better in the future because they got everything they needed 4 years later which helped them succeed in their life which helped people in the hospital have better health from the water and electricity. and less people got malaria by them getting bed nets, the crops grew better because they got fertilizer and what they needed to make people full again and didn’t have to worry if their children will go sick. and the yala sub-district hospital improved, midday lunch has been served at school

five dollars, but yet 20,000 people still die from malaria. that set the scene of how poverty stricken sauri really is. that is why i am amazed that now every sleeping sight now has bed nets, in only four years. so that tells me that it’s possible to make poverty a thing of the past.	second, the millennium project has given all farmers water, seeds, and fertilizer. and just four years before they had to worry about keeping up their families. in 2008 they are safe and secure, knowing that their crops will grow. 	lastly, the millennium project has allowed all students to go to school, beacause

terrible place, and some people are living in a wonderful place. but if the people living in a wonderful place just help the other people then we can help people learn and survive because in the text

nets can save their lives but it will cost $5 so people will have to give people jobs so they can earn money to buy bed nets. another reason why winning the fight against poverty is achievable is that people who get sick can go to the hospitals to get medicine but it would also take alot of time to make. lastly, the hunger problem can be solved if the materials needed could be free so crops can be made and it could feed millions of people so people wont starve to death. mainly to solve the problem there should not be charges.that’s why winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our

achive in 3 years from now. it says that some goals would be achived in 2015 and others in 2025. 2015-2012 = 0003. 2025 -2012 = 0013.in the 9th paragraph, they said the progress was amazing. also

beacause in 2004 many people did not have bed nets. then in 2008 every sleeping site had a bed net. which lowered the amount of people sick with malaria. if the amount of sick lowered it allows hospitals more space for more serious dieseases. that is only one tramatic improvment. another improvement that effected my opinion is at first schools didn’t serve lunch. then in 2008 the schools had lunch. which made the kids more foucused and make them achieve bigger and better goals. when someone achieve’s bigger, and better goals, they receive better payment. better payment can help you and your family servive. the last improvement i want to talk about is having water. in 2004 hospitals and families had no or very little running water. in 2004 hospitals and families had no or very

get harder because they don’t have real docters they only have clinical officer. and they might just be able to treat 2 or 3 paicents a day. with people being poor they might not get treated. some diseases like malaria, mosquitoes can carry it on by just biting a person. when it bites kids, they die easily, adults get sick. a bed net helps keep the mosquitoes away, but they cost $5 . 	some kids could only go to school, but some others can’t. the government was so poor that they had people pay for the schools. the reason why they could only have little people go is, they had hardly any school supplies. like they had few books, little paper, and they weren’t able to eat at midday.	even the farmers had little money. their crops were dying because they couldn’t afford the fertilizer

said that there are three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. this is such a shame! malaria is another serious problem. this is a common disease that could make many children die and many adults sick. a bed net is one solution, but it costs five dollars. there is also some cheap medicine, yet 20,000 children still die each day. bed nets still could of saved millions of lived in africa. one other huge problem i would really like to introdice is about education. many of the children in kenya are not getting the education they want and need. this problem is caused because parents could not afford school fees. there are barely any supplies to be used and there is no midday meal. imagine going to school for at least eight hours and not having anytime to eat. this brings up the problem with food. it is so sad because farmers could not afford the fertilizer needed and irrigation. this is a question we need to think about while thinking about this problem: do we have all the materials

sauri people did here copared to how they were before you would like living here better. if you want to know why it is because before 2008 they were in a painful situation. in sauri before 2008 people didn’t have bed nets all over sauri. kids there didn’t have lunch. nor did adults and kids have medicine to cure malarial. also they hospitals in sauri didn’t have generators for electricity. but the

it and make it better. they made plans to help the villagers from poverty. it shows that to never give up and think of special ways to help the poor village called sauri. 	the second example the convince me to say yes is when she mention the people who were dieing because sickness. it makes me want to believen harder that we can bring the the village better. there are many people who were sick no food and really really poor. those people also have little cloving. some people got infected by mosquito bites. we need to donate medicine money clothing and more. 	the third example is there a lot of poor, sad people. i don’t like people being sad and have a bad life. it makes me worry a lot and makes me want to help them. people sit in the dust selling some supplies of food witch means they need money to by medicine, and more. 	the fourth examples is when people crops are dieing, no water, and electricity. people eat dead crops in sauri because they don’t have water transportations. the soil have no nutrients. i don’t like that. i want them to have steady supplies. especially before winter. 	the part that makes me really sad and wish it can stop is when people in sauri villages die everyday. then there will be a shortage of people. so i wish the people who are planing a plan to help have to hurry. i wish luck to the villagers and planners.",1133501Y3_000539566.docx,"133501f11_000539566i think that hanna sachs conviced me that winning the war against poverty is achievable in our lifetime” because in this life time we can raise money by doing carwashes, selling lemonade and putting diefferent types stands to sell things to raise money to get people out of poverty. in this article hanna and her dad helped sauri improve on getting more water, more food, more space to grow crops, more shelter, and treatment in hospitals. in the begin of the villages project hanna and her dad had some troubles because each day about 20,000 kids died from a disease called millaria. so, there was a treatment called nets to get rid of the millaria, but the problem was that families couldn’t afford it because they had no money. but as hanna and her dad helped raise more money, they were able to help those in need and they were able to get people in sauri out of poverty. hanna’s goals were to get people out of poverty, assure them to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in the upcomping years. today people are still raising money to help those in poverty, such as the pepole in haiti. many celeberties such as mary mary, cindy lauper, janet jackson, ll cool j and jamie foxx are all still spending their money to help families in need. they even sang a song called “we are the world”. they sang that song for haiti to send them a message stating that people are here to help them and that they are never alone”. now that i have read this article i now, know., that anything is possible as

citizens in “non” countries have the luxury of going to schools and recieving a good education, villagers in countries like kenya don’t. very few children get to go to school in kenya. the program

because of mosquitoes carring malaria. this was be cause they couldn’t afford to get bed nets or have enough money to afford the right treatment there child needed. another example is that when the children went to school the didn’t get lunch because they couldn’t afford to feed them a midday meal. that’s how rough their their lives were and how poor they were. after the millennium villages project there life wasn’t so hard because there hospital has the medicines they need, running water, and a generator for the electricity. now the schools are serving lunch for the children. for example now when the children go to school they get lunch so now they are most likely focusing more and doing better. another example is when they go to the hospital they have water, electricity, and

either, because in the hospitals there were no doctors for the children and adults there were only clinical officers, and there were at least 3 children in one bed and 2 adults in another. when the mvphelped them there were alot more doctors and enough medicene, water and electricity for the children and adults.farms in kenya had no water and fertilizer for their crops,but the mvp made sure that they had it. the malaria disease killed people and was from mosquitos.kids would die and many adults would get sick.mvp would give them more bed nets for free because they were $5.00 and many people in kenya couldn’t afford them. the mvp really convinced me because the mvp helped the hospitals, malaria disease problem,farms, and schools. they convinced me because it shows that winning against proverty is achievable in our lifetime because alot of things was achievable in kenya. the author also convinced me because it showed that they already won the fight against proverty in kenya by helping the children and adults, and also by the mvp giving the hospitals, schools and farms the important things that they need like medicene, fertilizers, water and more. this is why the mvp/aurthor

there was no doctor, only a clinic officer running the hospital. it is hard for me to see people sick with preventable diseases, people near death when they shouldn’t have to be.” these quotes show that the natives have a poor lifestyle because they are suffering from disease. the natives were also poor. in the article, it also said, “their crops were dying because they could not afford the nessary fertilizer and irrigation. many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford school fees.” these quotes showed that they were poor. so far the life in sauri is bad, but it’s getting better. 	just in four years the people in sauri had better progress. the first paragraph under “a better life-2008” is proof that the people of sauri are getting better lives.

fight.  once people see that the cities are fine, they will stop supporting.  or, people will see less progress, day after day, month after month, &c. &c.  once people see the loss of progress they will begin to doubt they can win the fight.  as the doubt grows bigger, more people will stop supporting.  if there are less supporters, there will be a loss of money.  the cycle will start over again.      prices are another variable that can change the outcome of the fight.  if prices rise, there will be a shortage of money.  if there is a shortage of money, there will be doubts.  as i said before, the cycle of losing money will continue.     now, the biggest change of the outcome is corruption.  the people who organized the project will die.  new people will take over.  if the new

goals are supposed to be met, is only three years away. when the author wrote “winning the fight against poverty in our lifetime,” did she mean the poverty only in kenya, africa or the countries that are in poverty all over the world? if she was just writing about kenya, africa, then yes, i believe that the goals will be met by 2015 or so, because supposedly “dramatic changes has occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa,” and hopefully by now, better/more changes have occurred since 2008. now, if she meant the whole world will no longer have poverty, then that’s a bit exaggerated,

paying for a hospital bill. the medicine from the hospital is free of charge. the people in sauri can grow their own food because fertilizers and seeds have been addressed, which cost less than the

fertilizers and education are very important problems. i think it would be very easy winning the fight against poverty if just in 4 years dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages accross sub-saharan africa.      the plan is to get many people out of poverty as possible. people are not recieving the health attention they need. many people are dying because of the diseases that can always be prevented. there is no running water, or electricity in the hospitals. the rooms are packed with patients that wont get the treatment they need and cant afford it.     malaria is a very common treatable and preventable disease in africa carried by mosquitoes. kids die and adults get sick from it very easly. mosquitoes that carry malaria come around at night. a bed net treated with chemicals can last up to5 years and prevent malaria for the cost of only 5 dollars. yet thousands of kids are still dying because of how they're only living up to 1 dollar a day and cannot afford it.      another problem that is very common in africa is water, fertilizers and education. everyday farmers plant and grow crops and try to prevent them from dying because of the lack of fertizers and irrigation needed. kids cannot go to school because of the lack of money o pay the fees. there is only minimum of supplies and no midday meal making it very hard to concentrate.      now because of the help sauri, kenya recieved many people are getting the help and medical treatment needed. there are no school fees and the school now serve lunch. the hunger crises has been addressed with

fertilizer to grow and seeds to make crops. in just four years (2004-2008), they helped over 80 villages. the farmers was scared a few years ago about if they will have enough food to make their family survive and might the farmers children get sick because of hunger. a net cost 5 dollars and they get 1 dollar a day or maybe not. the bed nets help keep misquitoes with malaria to bite and give

lifetime. you cant just set a solid due date for things like this they take time. and often more problems rise. for right now it’s just malaria, fertilizer, water, and education. but what if new problems come into place. she said in the article “villages get technical advice and pratical items such as fertilizer, medicine, and school suplies. local leaders take it from there.” the message i received from those sentences are “we will give you what you need now, but after that, you’re on your own” she never mentioned that the project will keep providing for the villages once they are in need again.	although she has made good points that a lot of progress has been made and people are living better...what happens after 5 years and the bed nets have lost their chemical factor, or when all the fertilizer is gone, or the books are worn out and are no longer useable?  what are they going to do then? is the project going to come back for a second time to help again? like the begining of the article said, they’re living on less than $1 a day. but again, this is only a few villages, and one continent, what about all the other villages, in all the other continents. how are they going to be helped. also where is all the money coming from. nothing can be done without money. do they have donors? will these “donors” be able to continually donate money to the project. w/ho are the

in the following paragraphs i will explain why i think so.the author’s writing was not completely professional.  she often used improper grammer and asked questions that she did not answer.  one example of this when she said “the attendence rate is way up.”  not only is this improper grammer, it doesn’t give any reliable statistics.  the authors unproffecional writing shows that she may not be reliable. another reason why a reader may not be convinced is the authors irrationally large statements.  one of them is her statment that “winning the fight against poverty is achivable in our lifetime.”  while this may be possibly be true, it is not well supported.  throughout the article, all she talks about is kenya.  while kenya is a very poor country, there is poverty all over the world, even one of the most powerful countries, america.  the “fight against poverty” may end in kenya due to this project, but what about poverty in south america?  asia?  north america?  her writing is only narrowed to kenya, and nowhere else around the world.the final reason a reader may not be convinced is the authors lack of statistics.  she simply says that “attendance is way up” or “many kids do not attend school.”  she also, when using money, describes in american dollars.  if she had used kenyan form of currency, perhaps the reader would have a better idea of what it was like for

glad you have food, water, shelter, clothing, and are still living. before the millennium villages project had begun, kenya was living in continuous danger no electricity or running water. there were no doctors and patients didnt recieve proper treatments. malarial mosquitoes which carry malaria, a common diseases in africa come at night and bite children and adults thereby infecting them of the malaria diesease. kids easily die and adults get very sick. bed nets that keep away mosquitoes cost $5, but people struggled to get the amount of money. the same with medicines. for food, it was poor process. crops that farmers plants often tend to die because they could not afford necessary fertilizer and irrigation. many kids go hungry and become sick. parents want their children to get a good education, but they can’t afford school fees. some kids are needed to fetch water and wood. there were minimal supplies like books, paper and pencils in the year of 2004, but the students wanted to

opinion, the other did convince me that we can win the fight against poverty in our lifetime. although it is bad, many of the things causing poverty are actually preventable. for example, malaria can be prevented and treated with bed nets and medicine. water supply can be fixed with an irrigation system. farming problems can be solved by using better inventory and supplies. all this happened in four years. imagine what can happen in the next 8 years with many new inventions that can help out this poverty.",2123501Y3_000531717.docx,"yes it is achievable because almost anything is possible.

lifetime.",2121601Y3_000495925.docx,"yes, the author did convince me that “winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in their lifetime. to me this was achievable because they had to work ahrd and prove that they wanted to change and make africa a better and disease free place. the proved that they wanted change when the 12 year old girl said on paragraph 2-3 that the millennium village project was to help people get out of poverty, assure them acess to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. 	on paragraph 4 it says that in the day and year of 2004 they ahd followed the vilalge leaders to the yala  sub-district hospital. it wasn’t in avery good shape. 3 kids had to share a bed and the same was with 2 adults. the rooms were also very apcked because many patients could not afford the treatment or they did not have the treatment. 	on paragraph 5 and 6 the article starts to tell you about a common yet very deadly disease. this disease was called malaria. mosquitos carried the disease and infect people by biting them. kids can die from it easily and adults get very sick. many mosquitos that came a night carry malaria people have made bed nets that lasts 5 yeas for $5, yet about 20,000 kids die from the disease each day. 	another problem in africa is the fertilizer crops were always dying because farmers  could not afford fertilizer and because of irrigation. many farmers plant seeds knowing that it would be a poor outcome due to lack of fertilizer and water. each years faremrs worry if they have enoguh harvest to feed their kids and if their kids will go hungry, and become hungry. 	the last problem in sauri or africa would be that kids are not attending school just because tehir paretns cannot pay or afford schoolf ees. some kids don’t go because they are needed to help around the hosue with chores, like fetching water and getting wood. in 2004 schools had minimal school supplies, but this didn’t stop the children from learning. 	after all of thes problems with africa they showed that ehy were very serious about helping africa. on paragraph 9-10 it says that “sauri had made amazing progress in just 4 years.” the yala sub distract hospital now had medicine, which was free of charge they had cures for most common diseases. water was now conencted to the hospital, which also had a generator for electricity. bed nets were used in every sleeping site in sauri. the hunger crisis has been adressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain food supply. there are also

may ask why. well i’ll tell you why. all we need to end poverty is what happened in the past and what will happen in the future.	the millennium villages project has already started to do something about the poverty in sauri, kenya. they have provided sauri’s sleeping areas with bed nets to repel malarial misquitoes. they also connected a hospital, called yala sub-district hospitals with a source of water and electricity. they also gave farmers seeds and fertilizer to help end the hunger crisis there. and all of this was free of charge to the people in sauri. 	this isn’t enough though. we can end poverty in our lifetime only if more people do something about it. people can start donating to the people who need it. also, people can become members of projects like the millennium villages project. plus, people can even go pay poverty-sticken areas a visit and maybe even help them out by volunteering there.	these reasons lead me to believe that poverty can be ended in our lifetime. what people did in the past has already helped in this goal. what really matters is what people are doing now and what they will do in the future. if we all come together and actually do something, i know poverty can be ended soon.",3151601Y3_100209910.docx,"yes i think ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" i think we can, we can win the fight because

the treatment that they did will take too much time, not to mention money. maybe, if more people took action, poverty in many more places could be adressed and fixed like it was in sauri and places

nothing to having every thing. so, first the schools charged a fee, the farmers crops are dying and the hospital had no water, electricity, or medicine. there were no bed nets. lots of people was in proverty or people had little to no money. because of this people was dying and they had no money. in the article the girl said that pople was earning less than an dollar a day. over the years all this started to improve. there were bed nets, electricity in hospitalas well as medicine, there were no school fees so kids were able to get education, and the crops (the farmers) were able to live because the farmers may have got enough money. this proves that if you try hard enough you can achieve, “winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime”.i also think this article is inspiring because it tells how you can succeed if y ou keep your eye on the prize.(extras)this article is written in the first person. it uses “we” a lot. the girls is explaining her experience. i

sanitation ficillities so the/the water could be clean. also they didn’t have all the things we have in america there. i would (if i could) help them with all the things they need. like food or water.

be, no we can’t help the world from poverty. well, i would say yes, i think it is possible, if people really try to help and stop it.	first, i think poverty can be solved because from an essay a 12 year old wrote, lots of problems from sauri, kenya can be fixed. it was said that deadly bugs or diseases have spreaded and killed many people. there was no medicine for the sick and the wounded, no doctors avaiable or existing. no water or eletricity in the hospitals. but based on the information the essay gave it was fixed in four years.	secondly, if it was done once in sauri, kenya, i think it can help reduce deaths. for example, we need bed nets to stop the malaria from causing more deaths. and water to drian the hydration. medicine to cure the sick and wounded; so mostly by donating money we can have money for expensive items, that we need for others. 	lastly, using the example of sauri, kenya, children can have better educations. framers’ children can go to school without paying expensive fee. schools can provide the materials for kids. kids can have energy by eating a midday meal. so by helping others you can help save people lives a lot.	even though, some people may say poverty can never helped, but if we can help improve the ecodmy, lives can be saves so ways that we might be able to help poverty would be like; donating to the needed and eating less so we can save food and share some to others. 	so in my opinion, i think that poverty can be saved. because it was done because it can happen again. to fight againist poverty is a big thing, but if we can donate, and help reduce deaths, its worth it. for the sake of our future. i hope people make the right choices.",1106502Y3_000490605.docx,"hanna sachs convince me that we can win poverty and dieases.

and “beautiful” stuff that are expensive when they can be donating on sending items to people in poverty.	finally, the last reason why i’m convinced is that if everyone actually understood what was happening out there the people with needs and people who need items for survival, then, maybe some will help out, like the government or rich people.	in conclusion, i am convinced that winning the

can add up to win against poverty.",11111_089871054.docx,"i guess the article convinced me because africa did improve a lot by the looks of it. the things that improved were the hospital, school supplies, midday meals, malaria, fertilizers, and the supply of water. these things caused less deaths, better education, and better health.	the other part is, if the makers of the bed nett runs out of money to buy the materials, then they would lose their job and noone would be protected. also if droughts happen, they won’t have any water for themselves and they might die of thirst. if there’s no water, the hospital won’t have electricity which really doesn’t matter unless some people are scared of the dark.	the school day meals might also have a negative thing because if there’s a bully, then the bully would take some of the people’s lunch which they can starve to death. if people have lunch money, then the bully can take that too and then there would never be a safe school again. if people are being threatened, then they will try to skip school, which means they won’t get their education.	the thing i strongly agree on is fertilizer because you can always make more fertilizer from leftover food which can be reused. also, it helps make plants grow faster which means more food for the poor. compost is fertilizer that is free which almost everybody wants. free stuff makes people crazy because you don’t waste money.	there are things that need some more improvements by this is a pretty good start.",21382_020012067.docx,"i think that the author did convince me that

water popes to the hospital and they also installed a electricity generator for them to use machines and wash their hands from germs. the last example is that they gave medicines for all the most

schools now have school supplies.  the people have fertilizer and seeds to start growing food.  the schools now also serves lunch to students.  they just need to keep this up.they will need more

against poverty in our lifetime. one reason is because under the sub-heading “the fight for better health” they showed that preventable sickness was not treated because it could not be afforded. organizations such as the millenium villages project would be able to buy the bed nets that keep mosquitoes away and give patients the cheap medicine so that a preventable disease such as malaria will be able to prevent or cure malaria. this shows that diseases like this all around the world can be prevented or treated and lessen the poverty. in the third paragraph under “a brighter future” the article says that the project will assure these people health care which will let them spend less money on medicine and eliminate alot of sickness.	the second reason i was convinced was because of the second paragraph under the sub-heading “water, fertilizer, knowledge”. this paragraph stated that the kids did not have many materials they did not get a mid-day meal but they still worked hard to get an education. this convinced me because if they still work hard to get an education when they are older they will be able to make money and help out their homeland.	the third reason i was convinced that we could eliminate poverty is because of paragraph 3 under the sub-heading “a brighter future”. this paragraph states that the plan of the millennium villages project was to get people out of poverty, assure them access to health care, stabilize the economy and provide villages with supplies. i believe this will help get rid of poverty because if more people join in to help with this project it extend throughout the world and help even more people in poverty by providing them with the supplies they will need to stabilize the economy and quality of life. 	the fourth reason is the one that impacted me the most. the whole section titled “a better life” shows the changes that were made to the village of sauri. the hospital now has water, electricity & medicine. bed nets are used in every sleeping sight in sauri. the hunger crisis has been addressed by providing them with the tools to maintain the food supply such as fertilizer. there are no school fees and now serve lunch. this has made the attendance rate increase. all of this shows me that dramatic changes can be made to poverty across the world by using projects such as the millenium villages project. these

possible for important things like food, water, medicine, bed nets, and a good education. the article persuaded me to help as much as i can by donating money, sending fresh food, water, and school supplies. in the article it says many people are dying from diseases everyday and they don't have the medicine or proper caring they need to survive. for example, the adults and kids have to share an emergency bed together. the article says one main disease called malaria is from misquitoes that come out at night and bite the people. the article says in order to prevent this the people of sauri, kenya need bed nets. as i explained earlier money and other supplies can help buy these things for them. i think the people in sauri, kenya will deeply appriciate all of this, espeacially since they

common sickness. ex. 2 is where the farmers didn't grow eough food for their family, & some kids didn't go to school but the kids who did go to school",11261_020033320.docx,"can we win the fight against poverty?i don’t think so.  i think that going to sauri and 80 other villages across sub-saharan africa only was achieved because of the money over there.  for example, one dollar over hear in america is like cheap cash that you can’t buy much with, but over there, $1 can maybe buy them a pair of shoes.  money over there is less than us, so our money seems like a lot to them.  so the people doing the project only spend maybe a couple hundred for a big change in each village.  but coming over to america to solve our poverty problems is a whole different story.  our country is very expensive, so who would have enough money to pay for all of our poverty?  who?  there is always poverty in each country, but do you think that we have enough money to solve all of that?  even in donations.  like on the second page in the first passage, a net for them only costs $5!  5.  they can’t even afford that.  but us, we could.  well most of us.  even people in canada could afford it.  if i were to go and live in sauri now with my family, we would be the rich to them.  what will maybe happen is that the country that has more money will help the weaker one.  that will go on and on with the countries until there is 1 country that costs too much to be able to solve its poverty.  this is only my opinion and prediction.  this is only someones dream.  and like in the article, these people feel sorry for them.  i think that is the nice that they do help the people, but like i said before, who would help the countries that cost too much to even live in?  well our country maybe not as poor, but we still have a lot of poverty too.  not as much though i do think that we can solve the poverty in the extra poor countries though, because their money is less compared to us, so we won’t be spending a lot compared to canada or other different places.  hopefully, the world will change in a good way.  i do like to see people who were really sad but got happy because of people who helped them.  i love to see people be happy and smile a lot too.  hopefully in a few years, i will be proved wrong and poverty will end.  hopefully.  when i grow up, i will be the kidn of person that donates all i can to the people who really need it.  even if i’m really poor.  i will do all that i can.  hopefully my fellow classmates will too.  it won’t be easy though.  but with the help, it can go a long way.  whenever my school had a food drive, i would always donate.  it’s easy, and knowing that you have helped someone can really make you happy.  it make me happy.",1127501Y1_000560375.docx,"i think the reason why the author thinks it’s important for kids in the united states to learn about how life was like in kenya before and after the millennium villages project is because she wants more people to fight against poverty. if more people try to end poverty, the faster it will be done. i think the author wants me to know this information because she cares about the people in kenya. i also think it’s because she and other people are succeeding in getting people out of poverty and making progress. the author wants more people to help the people

more fortunate can help third world countires become wealthier. to me this is one of the most important examples of them all. this next article tells of how the children have been given the opportunity to go to school with no cost and won’t have to worry about helping their parents in the field, or running out of energy during school since they are given midday lunches. 	that can also be proven correct because of the way that the hospitals have been upgraded to thelp people overcome common diseases such as malaria. to many doctors these diseases could be easily treated but since

milenium village of sauri, kenya, from a village of full poverty to a well-organized and good economic place of well-trained and healthy people. this explains that being able to fight the world of poverty is possible and achievable. 	the millenium villages project was a project that was metioned in the article. this project was supposed to help, or support, villages who were poor and in poverty to be help themselves up to be a more economic, wealthy, healthy, and safe place. the plan, as said in the beggining of the article, was to assure them access to healthcare and help villages stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. the villages would get techical advice and practical items such as fertilizer, medicine, and school supplies. this plan would work for

villages project. the author did not convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty in our lifetime"" is possible. 		one reason is the health conditions they originally ahd. in the hospital it was 3 kids to a bed or 2 adults to a bed. the rooms were full of patients who would not recieve treatment, because they didn't have the money or the hospital did not have it. in addition to those poor conditions there was no actual doctor just a clinical officer. but the worst thing was they didn't have running water or electricity. 		second, is disease. malaria is a common disease in africa and is both preventable ant treatable. there are bed nets which have been treated with chemicals that last 5 years and repels mosquitoes. despite all this an average of 20,000 children die each year from malaria. 		then is food and hunger. in sauri the crops were dying because of lack of water or fertilizer. families plant many seeds but few crops are even barely successful. every year farmers worry do they have enough food to feed the whole family or will their kids go hungry and become ill. 	last is education and problems with it. in sauri lots of children to not attend school, because their paretns could not afford school fees. another reason is children have chores. the schools had only minimum supplies of books, paper, and pencils. at the school there was no midday meal so the children had no energy. 		those are the reasons i do not think ""winning the fight against poverty in our lifetime"" is possible.",31432_020013260.docx,"i believe that poverty is combatable in an average lifespan. although it is extremely unlikely that a immense problem will be solved in approximately 70-80 years. i believe that poverty in sauri and other poor places will be more suitable for human life, considering sauri’s amazing improvement in 4 years, which is relatively small compared to a human’s average lifespan. poverty can abolished if other problems can be solved and disappear, but problems seem to appear more than go away. destruction is simpler than creation, i believe that poverty can be dealt away with if we have perfect or near perfect conditions. also  natural problems such as global warming and shortages are not the only problem. human evils such as greed can cause people to commit crimes more and more, which will just end up not helping poverty. i believe evil cannot be held back forever, and the same with good. poverty may disappear for a while but it will come back in some way. poverty can also be in different forms. country-wide poverty is more focused

time, life is to short.	people don't care because they are so caught up in their own lives. also, because people want money and don't care what other people have. people don't care about whats happening on the earth only whats happening to them.	people think it's a waste of time because there is already so many people effected. humans that are my age are in ""the now network"". humans are so caught up in the electronics that they will forget about the suffering people in kenya.	i think life is too short to change what has happened. though my age is young the damage that is already

why i think putting an end to poverty in my lifetime is acheivable if we follow millenium's lead. that i got from a story about a villages called millenium. which was once a village with not very many crops, very little school kids, your average pay was one dollar a day, and in hospitals their were three kids in a bed and not much medicine.	milennium has now improved it's hospitals and that only took 4 years. they improved the hospitals by having more medicine, ant not charging to have to go to a hospital. this will help people get a job in millenium instead of being sick all the time. if we put our minds to it we can help people get a chance to get a job.	millenium has also improved it's schools with more school suplies and zeroe fees to go to school. now their is more children attending schools in millenium. if we have more schools like this in the rest of the world, people will know more. there from people will have more jobs. this is just one easy way to stop poverty.	suprisingly even good fertilizer makes a difference. the reason is because fertilzer helps the plants grow so the people in millenium will have more food. we can also give people more fertilizer.	just one simple step",31182_084861058.docx,"i think that winning the fight is possible because there are many people who wish to help and assist in this project. in the last aparagraph,

don’t they have a small hut or what you want to call it, it is so small just aout four kids would have to share a bed and if it was no more, room some would have to sleep on the floor. another example is school we can get a good education but around here kids act like they don’t want to when in kenya they are dieing for and education but it seem they could never get it and they never have the

hurricanes tornatos all of these disater are making it waste to stop poverty and some people are all ready broke and cant donate anmd some people are petty to donateto help out to make it better for

united nation organization gave the people or kenya school supplies and fertalizer and seeds to grow crops and medication to help sickness. in 4 years their was free medicationfor any sickneses and

our lifetime. the examples in the text show why i feel this way. the main purpose is to inform you about the poverty problems and what they are trying to accomplish to help the peoplein suari, kenya. o ne reason is that the article talked about the possible acheivments they can make like getting net beds to help with the mosquitos. another is  they know exactly what to do to help with health and

lifetime. i believe this because it took sauri, kenya 4 years to recover. in order for sauri to achieve this goal they had to cut back on school fees, have bed mats for everyone, and now the hospital finally has water and electricity. if it took 4 years to fix sauri, then every village might take 4 years. with so many towns with poverty it would take years and years.      i also say that we can't acomplish this because what happens if a city we helped loses supplies, or runs out. like sauri running out of fertilizer. if we keep having to replenish supplies, then the town isn't really becoming poverty-free. we can't help a single town forever. to fix one town costs thousands of dollars, and a whole bunch of supplies. with so many towns with poverty, we spend even more money. the job isn't impossible, but we can't fix it in one lifetime.      in addition because in sauria electricity was scarce and cost a lot of money to replenish it. in addition to the fertilizer, food, and clean water bills, electricity adds to the cost of everything. before you know it we're up to millions of dollars on 1 town. but with many struken poverty towns it would be hard. the united states alone can't come up with the money. if all of the countries in the world contribute to his cause, we might be able to.      lastly i don't believe we can't abolish poverty in the whole world because, some countries don't want to contribute. they are selfish, and have race issues. if those countries put that aside, we might be able to do it. but once again, it will take many, many years to complete this very big work. we can do it, if we all work together as the world. you might not be able to see it in your lifetime, but you may see a couple of towns become poverty

there are so many reasons what poverty does to people. for an example, the people of sauri are affected by poverty issues in school, and hospitals. later there will be reasons why winning the fight

get technical advice and practical item, such as fertilizer, medicine and school supplies but they dont get enough.		another explanation is in a hospital called the yala sub-district hospital there are not that many hospital beds and in each there are either 3 children or 2 adults in each. the hospital was run by a clinical officer with no doctors in the building. there was no running water or electricity; however, they used water from near by rivers or lakes.	i think winning the fight against poverty is acheivable. we could send materials from the u.s. or from china or japan to help. researchers could bring supplies with them to sauri and africa to help the whole sub-continent of africa. we could also bring doctors and teachers with us to africa and hire them to the schools and hospitals.	agains poverty is hurting people and is suffering the people of africa. i think that we can win the fight against poverty because we have power, we have the power to help. to sum it up

of view. she presented a great argument on the first page, using facts and opiions that really played with my emotions and made me feel sorry for the people of kenya. the article was sort of upsetting until the section, a better life-2008 cheered me up and motivated me to wat to help and keep up this progress. i feel like maybe there is still hope cos the people of kenya and depsite the few problems ha have no solution yet, their lives have been improving.i really like this pasage because it did inform me about what is happening on this planet but it also made me want to take action. the last page alone made me feel like it was my repsonsibility to learn more about kenya and to see how i can help as an individual.the article did more than just convinced to agree with the author it encouraged me to keep up with this progress and motivated me to want to help. so, i definitely think it is more than possible to achieve these goals, if we put our minds to it.",1128601Y2_000514995.docx,the author convinced me that wining the fight against proverty in this life time because in the beginning of the ???? in project the people in sauri could barely pay for school and they lived off a dollar a day and they couldn’t afford bed nets to keep away the miquitoes with maleria. but in 2008 the millennium villages project helped for be to have ever medision and bed nets in the hospital and in regular houses and clean water is being provided to hospitals and agenirator to provide electricity to hospitals and kids go to shool free of charge and the hunger crisis has been addressed with seeds and fertilizer for fresh crops. and because of two million project tall people in sauri have crack water and efficient hospitals to treat common diseases.,31082_020032719.docx,"i think they can because it says they had to use bednets so kids and alduts so they wont get malaria. so there basicly saying they made bednets to provent malaria. i think what the author went was that the people of sauri didn’t have alot of money they had to survive on $1 on less a day, it said that they also didn’t have alot of school suplies such as books, pencils, papers. they didn’t have mid-day meals and water. if some thing happens like children get sick or adults get sick. they may not have enough money to go to the hospitle and they may not get any treatment. i just wanted to point out that 20,000 kids die each day from malaria. it said some rooms were fuller ther were 3 kids to abed and 2 adults to abed. some patient would not get treatment because they didnt have enough money to pay the fee. some kids didnt even go to school because there parents couldn’t pay the fee, so i think they needed to maintain food suplies. the other thing was that, the person who was telling the story  (the 12 year old) was being spasific and how it happenend, who was there, how they survied and how they didnt, the year, the state and city.",11292_088252508.docx,"the author convince me because something similar happened to i am diseabled and i think i can improved just like they did. one example that shows that they can improve is

people of sauri had made amizing changes in the last four years.",21251_020036998.docx,"i would argue that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime” for several reasons. first, people didn’t have good hospitals with the right medicine, farmers didn’t have fertilizer, or irrigation systems set up, and children couldn’t afford to go to school.	hospitals were really bad in places like sauri. there wasn’t a proper doctor, no running water or electricity and rooms were packed with sick patients. several people shared a bed and who knows how many beds were in a room. most of the patients died because the hospital either didn’t have the right medication or couldn’t afford it. the “doctor” was really only a clinical officer.	most farmers didn’t have enough crops and most of them were dying. they didn’t have the proper fertilizer and didn’t have enough seeds. they also didn’t have an irrigation system set up. since alot of people only live off a dollar a day the farmers probably didn’t have enough money to be able to afford the right tools, which they need to get good crops.	last, families had to pay for their kids to go to school to learn what they could. i don’t know how much schools cost but based on the attendance rate it wasn’t cheap. once at school kids didn’t even get lunch. so by the end of the day kids were really tired and hungry.	over four years there have been dramatic changes all throughout the sub-saharan africa. the hospital has medicine which is free, there is water and electricity. there are bed nets which can prevent malaria.",4119501Y1_000405353.docx,i think this is important for kids to know because we should be graceful for what we have. not everyone has clothes that are not tattered. they sometim don’t even have shoes. also kids should know that there is change and it has got better. there is no exsuase once so ever why kids can not go to school you no longer have to pay a fee. now everyone has bed nets so they can prevent the mosquitoes who carry the malaria. now the hospital has medicines that are free of charge there is water and electricity. a lot has change now.,21122_020033766.docx,"the author has convinced me to think ""winning the fight against poverty is achieveable in our lifetime"". one reason i say this is cause in 2004 there were school fees but 4 years later there was. also up to 20,000 kids die from diseases because they didn't have the hospitality to gain the help, now they have running water and electicity. in sauri at school they didn't have access to lunch or supplies, but now they have access to lunch because of that sauri has more kids to teach which leads to more people to get an education. if this all happened in 4 years without the entire world, i believe that it can be done in 2015, only if everybody in the world contributes.",21381_020011991.docx,"in 4 years of fighting poverty an made a big difference in sauri, kenya. the millenium villafe project has

sickness. water and electicity were running through the hospital. farmers could now grow crops with the neeessary tools, fertilizer, and seeds. kids will be educated since there will be no school

i read, i do think that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. the author was able to show how africa improved three years ago and talked about the supplies needed to fight poverty in africa. knowing that africans could not be cured, educated, or healthy seven years ago attracted people who werewillling to help. health care in africa was poor. therewere three children to a bed and there was no water or electricity. people who are fighting death don’t have medications because they are not there or they are too expensive. fortunately, medicines soon became free to fight common diseases. farmers worried that they would starve because their crops were dying due to a lack of fertilizer and water. without fertilizer to support the growth of crops, farmers feared starvation and sickness from a lack of food. without water, people couldn’t sterilize and communicable diseases became common. fertilizer and seeds, a long with supplies to support crops were sent to address the hunger crisis in africa. schools in africa are never free and children do house work instead. schools donot have the supplies needed to educate children and work with the little supplies they had or could afford. there was no midday meal and children left with little to no energy. now, there are no school fees and schools now serve lunch. the attendance rate has increased. people are doing their best to prevent poverty in africa. we are donating money and supplies needed to prevent diseases and support education. if this can be achieved now, it can beachieved in my time. we all have to do whatever is possible to prevent poverty and i am willing to do what is neccesary.",41411_020025376.docx,"this is about a girl named hannah sachs and she is 12. and she went to kenya to see

tools needed for food supply.",2112601Y2_000495785.docx,"yes, i do think that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". in this essay i will give my top 3 reasons why.	one reason is in 2004 healthcare was bad. at the hospital there were 3 kids or 2 adults to one bed. also, the hospital did not have running water or electricity. the hospital rooms were pack with patients who probably would no recieve treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patient could not afford it. also, 20,000 kids are dying a day from the preventable, treatable, and common disease of malaria.	another reason is in 2004 crops were dying because the farmers could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. each year the farmers worried about having enough food for their whole family or if their kids would go hungry and become sick. also, many kids did not go to school because they could not afford the school fees. some kids were needed at home to help with chores. the schools had minimal supplies, but the students wanted to learn. all of the students worked hard with few supplies. it was hard for them to concetrate because there was no midday meal.	lastly, in four years there was amazing progress. the hospital has medicine, free of charge, for common diseases. the hospital has water and electricity. bed nets are used at every sleeping sites. bed nets are nets that are treated with chemicals to keep the malaria infested mosquitos away. the hunger crisis has been addressed with ferilizer, seeds, and tools needed to maintain the food supply. there are no more school fees and lunch is served at school.	in conclusion i think ""winning the fight againtst poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". if that much proggres was

everywhere in the world. and we can't help them if we don't know they exist or not. if the health in sauri was terrible witht the mosquites with malaria and 20,000 kids ding quickly once bitten then

strong economy and billionaires dont wanna share their money. my first reason is that when billionaires pay their taxes we can get the money and donate to the millennium development goals. my second reason is that if we can give fertilizers, food, and medical supplies we can at least help a little bit to the poverty cities. lastly, we can still win the fight against poverty because we have alot of money and we can give it to the poverty cities.",11021_089831002.docx,"i would like to think so. i mean, there are alot of people out there. suppose i live to be 70-90, with 60 something years to go. i believe we can help people get out of poverty. “the people of sauri have made amazing progress in just 4 years.” look, they’ve done so much in four years. we could probably help others. 	of course, the rate of change from poor to average would depend on how many people were on the job. it also depends on how skilled the “helpers” are. for example, if one of the people on the job was a docter, i could tell him to go help the hospital. this is just sad; “there was no doctor, only a clinical officer running the hospital.” the doctor/somebody with medical knowledge could teach the hospital. 	last thing, even if we can’t win the fight over poverty in my lifetime, we would get a lot done. many people would be much happier. “dramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages across

the text, ""the people of sauri made amazing progress in just four years."" this is an example of improveing. if people are really trying to help people, society and the whole country, there's no such

improving, there won't be ""poverty""	oh! some people says it is imposible to fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. they may say ""what if people don't like to work and being lazy. or they don't have enough money to do this and that for people."" the thing i want to say is that being lazy really can't against poverty, if they don't want to work, the affect that happen to them is

lot left to do. so, it shouldn’t take that long. another that hannah said to inspire me was when she said “ the people at suari have already made many changes in only 4 years.” that tells me that if it only took them 4 years to make many life changing changes. then it wont take us long to finish what they have started. ms. sachs also listed  some examples of how they have improved over the past 4 years, she said “ the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all common diseases. water is connecyed to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. bed nets are

the people of suari could have a better life, like ours. these poor people need help, help that we can provide, by just taking some time out of the day to help them. like  helping them prevent ticks, building them some real homes, and giving them more protective clothing to wear. little stuff such as donating five dollars can, the littlest things always count! so work hard to help.",41032_020029583.docx,"i think that the author did a really great job about convincing us that we can really make a difference. one way she did that was that she metioned about millennium

some are 2025. on that day on 2004, it was not in very good shape. there were not enough beds, no doctors, and no water or electricity. that is what the author is trying to change!the third way was that she talked about the better life in 2008. it was much better than 2004 because they had free medicine and the hostipal and they had free schools and it comes with lunch. and at last she talks

them. they stuff they needed more was health care, water, fertilizer, books, paper, pincils and these are some reasons why they need health care because they are dung the need water to grow corps they

persuaded me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable. i was persuaded because if the millienium villages project can keep doing what they're doing now eventually not just suari but all other poverty-striken areas can heal and rebuild the villages. farmers are already being provided with seeds and fertilizer. soon, they can have a whole field of grain , vegetebles, or fruits the whole village can enjoy. also, hospitals have medicine that can cure certain dieseases like malaria. eventually this hospitals will be able to help those who have gotten sick with deadlier diseases such as cancer. finnaly, schools have already improved providing new materials like text-books, and pencils. also, they have a lunch period. with this continuing, kids can get expensive materials to use in schools such as calculators, or even computers. due to these improvements, i was persuaded that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.",31001_020034428.docx,"i think

against poverty.",2121601Y3_000535484.docx,"this story convinced me. but first let me explain the quote in the queston. they mean poverty is a war that takes a lifetime to be beaten. when i read that first paragraph i secretly  read ahead of the others. i'm going to read more about the millennium village project. here's some things that conviced me. first they improved health and money. next, they helped farmers get better water for their crops and fertilizer. then, they helped schools. last, they gather information. it was a sucsess but the job is not done. their are other things. but i'll go in depth about the things in the text. first about the health. they had started to used bed nets. bed nets are nets that protect you from bugs while you sleep. about the farmers, the water they had\didn't have was bad. so the crops were dying and they could not feed their family. know the people came and the water is better and they brought fertilizer. know the farmers can feed their family. well with edjucation they had few books and suplls. they learned what the can. also they can't concentrate because of the lack of lunch. know they have a lunch so what they learn stays in their head.",3118501Y1_000447244.docx,"i think the author want us to learn about kenya because it tells how live was in kenya and tell us how poor they were. life in kenya was poor, they had no money, tattered clothes, & not enough food to eat in kenya. now after that they had food, cash and clothes. so that is why we learn about kenya.",21081_020071845.docx,"yes, because nothing is impossible as long as you don’t stop. the author wrote about how awful their lif was and wrote this artical to support millenium village project. the author wrote “sauri’s progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achieveabl in our lifetime”. so i thought i won’t anything, but now that i think about it i might help the people.my dream is to become a football player and this article is almost the only thing that is giving me courage. so i will not stop and follow my dream. the author’s goal was to help them and she did not stop before that place was terrefying and now i visulize that this place is getting better.",11182_020086879.docx,"based on this example, i believe that the quality of life in sauri can be improved in our lifetime. i believe this because major changes have been made over the years to improve the life in sauri. for example, in the text it states, ""the yala-sub district hospital has medicince, free of charge, for all of the most common disease."" having free medicine for the most commone diseases is a big step because hospitals now have most of the medicines needed to help treat patients. a big step like this is already a good start to saving thousands of lives.	in the article, the infromation says, ""bed nets are used in very sleeping site in sauri."" in my opinion, this would be the beginning of something great. without the bed nets, mosquitos were infecting humans with a disease called malaria. this disease was very tragic. everyone's life was at risk. now that there are bed nets being provided, the rate of lives being taken away is much lower. people wont have to worry about getting a deadly disease or fear going to sleep.	i would say that one of the biggest changes is that the problems farmers had was being addressed. they were now proivded with fertilizer and seeds, along with toools to keep their land in great shape. no longer do the farmers have to worry about making enough to maintain the foos supply. farmers would be able to provide for their families and their farm.	last but not least, another great change was taking away school fees and serving midday meals for the children. as a resule, the attendance rate was much higher at school. families could send their children to school and not worry about having to pay a fee. children could get a great education for free. due to the fact that school lunches were provises, kids had energy and would less likely be so hungry.	there were so many changes that were made. i truly believe that with everyone's help and support, the goals set for the future can and will be reached. it's amazing to see just how far a country in africa can go, when everyone sticks together and helps eachother out. based on the article, i definitely believe that together we can stop the high rates of poverty in sauri. i am a firm believer that if you believe it, you can achieve it.",21062_020044360.docx,"yes, the author convinced me to agree with her because when people in saharan die from starvation because their crop has no water, and fertilizer. “it was hard for them to concentrate, though, as there were no midday meal.” many kids didn’t go to school because they couldn’t afford the school fees. over 20,000 kids die from diseases caused by mosquitos. (bed nets can protect you when you are sleeping from mosquitos, they cost $5.) they want their goal to end at 2012 and the others at 2025. at the end of each day, kids run out of energy because they don’t have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. at 2008 life becomes better at saharan, bednets in every sleeping site, water and electricity, and they get lots of crops now. their goal was to get saharan get out of poverty and have a better life. kids in millennium village in sauri wear tattered clothes and walk on bare feet. “there are no more school fees, and the school now serves lunch for the students. the attendance rate is way up.” when hannah sachs was 12 years old, people that lived in kenya, sauri, lived less than $1 dollar a day. many changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa.",3151601Y3_100310274.docx,"based on the article the author does show that this is substainable to archieve. proverty could be stufed in a life time because they are started a project to help the community and their lives. the project could help because people wear tatterd clothes and get money that us less than 1 dollar. we could stop proverty by helping giving them more supplys because when they shie it it takes lot of time to ship it to kenya. so if we give them more supplyes then when they retreive it then they would have more supplyes. the project helps kenya alot and if the project keeps helping them they would stop proverty because they are saying that they will end proverty when its 2015 or 2025 and that would give alot of time ti improve the goal to stop proverty for life. the project to help kenya and stop proverty has caused a big change of diseases because they sold nets to people in kenya because of the misquito’s that give them diseases for 5 dollars, so the people of the project gave it to people for free. the goal of stoping proverty is posible because the project has been changing life and helping kenya and is stoping proverty from kenya from life. so the author has convinced me that the goal of stoping proverty for life is posible.",2118591Y2_000486512.docx,"yes, i think that the author convinced me that ""winning the fight against proverty, because in the story it says, that in 2004, ""sauri was very poor they didn't have water, electricty, and had no money."" also, that affcted them because they needed money so they can gain more money, so it can help them get achiveve their goals. also, they has mosquitoes that bit them and gave them malaria when they bit the people of sauri. also, in sauri proverty is achieveable because in the story it says, ""the hospital's in sauri had medicine."" also the villages had water and electricity. for example, ""the hunger crisis has been addresssed with fertilizer and seeds."" also, there are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished, but that will be a very hard task. but can we make those solutions? yes, be uniting with other people from sauri to gain richess and wealth. but sauri's progress shows us all that winning the fight against proverty in 2004 people were hungry, people were selling bannas of the street, no electricty and water, but all of that can change in 4 years by working together in diffrent ways. also, there were no school fees, and the school now serves lunch for the students because they didn't have any midday meals to provide them with energy they need to help them with the rest of their days. also, dramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages. like the progress is encouraging to supporters of the millennium villages projects. what will really take is for the world to work together to change poverty-skricken areas for good. why, because i want this kind of poverty to be a kind of history.",2106502Y2_100266463.docx,"how would you feel if you were a person in kenya dieing from malaria because you couldn’t avord a bed net. thousand’s of children die each day because the don’t have a bed net. did the aurthor provide a convincing argument that “winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime”? i think she did because in 2004 they were in need of free education, electricity, water, school suplies, fertilizer, more clothes shoes, and so much more. then in 2008 they went from down to up they have free education, fertilizer for food, more beds for hospitals and medicine, and bed nets in every living sight in sauri. in my opinion i believe that to help the kenyan people we need more supporters and more water in there homes and electricity. what might happen in 2015 if things were geting better in 2008. in 2015 it would be so much better children and adults will not have to worry about dieing the nexy day. i feel that the people of sauri are going to have a relaxed future because they have everything to survive and even now in school they serve lunch to everybody not just to the lucky people because in 2004 the schools where serving lunch only to the lucky ones. why do you think the people of kenya only made less than a dollar each day imagine if you made 25¢ a day and no bed net and had to work extra hard so you can provide bed nets for you and your children. what if you didnt make enough money in time and you got affected by mallaria and you got very sick and you had to go to to the hospital and you had to share a hospital bed with two other people? my reason for stating this is that we dont have to go through what their going through we have to be thankful that we have food to eat every day, electricity, good water, and that when we go to the hospital we dont have to share a bed. i believe that the sauri people are going to have a nice future in 2015.",21031_020028530.docx,i think that people will get more money and get out of poverty beacause the american banks or whoever makes money can make money for them and onother way people can get out of poverty is they can work really hard. america had bin donating money to africa and there has ben some change another way is if the people from africa came to america and got jobs that pay well they would be sucsessfull and earn money and those are gret ways to make money. i think that poverty in africa will stop beacause humana got stuff for africa and if we keep doing that they will get out of poverty they got medacine so the people in africa will stop

author convinced me. one example is that if the author was 12 in 2004, then she is 20 now. if she has kids in 2012, then she waits 12 years for them to turn her age in 2004. the world poverty situation will not end in 2024. this project took at least $1000 dollars. the text reads, “dramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages”. that’s $80,000 dollars fight there. there are at least just as many, if not more poverty situations across the world. we are already several trillion dollars in debt. we can’t afford to treat that many situations like this one. if we do that, we will all be hobos living on the street “due to bankruptcy”. 	also, the author even states, “it will not be an easy task.” if 20,000 kids die each day from malaria, than 200,000 kids die every 10 days. if this keeps happening, there will be no more people in impoverish places. oh, and don’t say my logic isn’t clear. 	another thing is that the author states, “what it will take is for the world to work together.” the world will never work together. there are communist countries that have nuclear weapons. if we try to force them to work together, they will use their weapons. we will retaliate back and the world will turn into a nuclear holocaust. 	that is why the author didn’t convince me.",2129501Y2_100138806.docx,"i believe that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our

families, and we can give them free health care and running water, medicine, and proper staff in hospitals so they all stay in good health.	giving the people in sauri money will give them a better life in many ways. the people will be able to buy the resources they need to live. they will be able to get necessary things like food, clothing, and fertilizer and water. the money wood help them very much and will benefit their lives. money is something we can help them with and that can change their lives in beneficial ways.	sauri farmers don’t have much luck when growing crops because they lack of resources. so we should help them grow their crops and give them proper resources. the farmers’ crops die and wither because they don’t have proper materials to grow crops. we can supply with high quality fertilizer and an irrigation system that will get the water they need. these things would help them a lot it would allow the plants to supply them with food and their children and families won’t ever suffer with hunger. it would give them food that would be everlasting and would make their lives better.	we can give the people of sauri medicine & the right health care treatment. medicine would help them prevent and treat diseases and sicknesses and keep them healthy. they can be given a trained stuff to help the sick people and know what to do. the hospitals should be supplied with running water and a generator to give them power. the health care would help them stay healthy and strong and would make the death rate in sauri lower and help the people prevent sickness.	the author convinced me that “the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.” giving the people that are poor the things they need to live would make their lives a lot more enhanced and would mean a lot to them. the fight is something  defeat. we would need money and supplies to destroy poverty and make it history. i believe we can deplete poverty forever we just need a team. i am convinced by the author and support it.",21131_020012903.docx,"from this article, i believe that it is fair to say that it is passible to end poverty globally. if we work on it we can end poverty everywhere. in this essay i will discuss why and how this is possible. 	in the article, “a brighter future”, author hannah sachs states that, “a bed net, treated with chemicals that last for 5 years, keeps malarial mosquitoes away from sleeping people. each net costs 5 dollars”. this tells me just how easy it is to save millions of lives. also it explains how the problems dealt with in poor villages are treatable. 	a second example is, “many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford school fees”. that sentence shows me one more way to make life better in small, poor villages worldwide, not only in sauri. if kids could go to school they could be successful later in life. that could bring money in to many families. this would also help more villages become more technologically advanced. 	when sachs states, “the people of sauri have made amazing progress in just 4 years”, it implies that our goals for a btter future in small civilizations globally is not just a fantasy. it really will happen soon. it is easy and even the smallest things help. life already improved greatly in sauri in only four years. that gives hope to

make a change if we all worked together. they helped 80 vilages across sub-saharan africa that made huge differences. i think by this rate they can help other poor villages and make a change to others. this convinced me that i could make a difference if i help and donate to to others, by helping plant so people could harvest and feed there familys by donating cloths, paper, water, and money  to help familys rise from proverty.when i first was reading i thought how are they going to supply all that stuff and i thought it was impossible but if you reach out and donate it is possible to make a huge change just like that. they made sure the people in kenya have the stuff that they need to survive.	just reading this convinced me that you could make a change the acomplished so much in just 4 years imagine what they could do in 15, they could stop proverty around the world.",21061_020030123.doc,"i think that this project will be successful. i think this because if 4 years they fixed some of the big problems.	they fixed the schools by not having a fee to go to school and they added a midday meal. since that the schools attendance has went up.	the second problem they fixed was the hospitals. they added medicine with no charge for the most common diseases there. the people doing the project added a pipe that brings water to the hospital and installed a generator for electricity. they started to give people bed nets to keep away the malaria dieases.	one of the biggest problems they solved was that they helped the farmers. they helped the farmers by giving them fertilizer and they helped they make irrigation systems, one thing that helped the farmers out the most is that they gave the farmers now tools. since then the farmers have been keeping a stable food supply.	they have help do that in about 80 villages around sub-saharan africa. the workers have also been working on to stop impoverished in saharan africa and is trying to have the world join in to help.	so in conclusion i am pretty sure the winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time.",3110591Y2_000549988.docx,"i think we can achieve the goal against poverty because we

think that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. because according to the milennium villages project, there has been astonishing progress during 2004-2008. the yala-sub district hospital, which used to have a shortage of medicine, water, doctors, etc, now has free medicine that can treat many common diseases, so that even poor people can take it. the hospital also has water and electricity now, which is a big improvement from before.	 malaria, for instance, is a very common disease in africa, from which around 20,000 kids die from everyday. malaria is caused by mosquitoes, and to prevent the mosquitoes from coming & biting you, you can obtain a bed net. bed nets used to be too pricey, but today, every sleeping site uses them! now people can be safe from malaria.	another huge improvement were the farmers’ crops. the food was withering and dying because the farmers weren’t able to afford good fertilizer & irrigation. now though, the project has provided them with fertilizer and seeds, along with tools to keep the food plentiful.	another big part of life is education. in 2004, a majority of children didn’t attend school, either because their families couldn’t afford it, or the children were at home tied up with chores and familuy responsibilities. in 4 years, the have become free (no cost) for everyone to attend, and they even serve lunch! now the majority of children do go to school and get a good education. 	all because of the milennium villages project, the residents of sauri, africa now have a much better life than they did years ago. which means the project did achieve their goal. and that just further proves that winning the fight against poverty is definetely achievable in our lifetime. especially if you’re going to have a long, hardworking lifetime.",4121501Y2_000519816.docx,"the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. i say that because multiple examples of

cant afford to pay. so barely ny kids have educations.and people were waking around in cloth and starving. they didn’t have enough money to eat like they should.then 4 years later those problems were fixed. now hostiplas have electricity, move beds and running water and now schools are free so more kids can go to school. and now poor people have help, so they won’t starve or have to were

2025 judging by what had been accomplished on 2008. they could be growing healthy crops by 2025 if they keep helping them with the necessay fertilizer and irrigation system. the schools would be full of kids getting their education and having a better future. the hospitals could be advanced. they could have all types of medicines, and if the school become advanced hospitals could have future doctors and surgeons coming their way. this could for sure be accomplished. with hard work many things could be achieved and sauri, kenya could have a brighter future. 	poverty is happening all over the world. in my opinion we shouldn’t just stop in kenya. we should help countries all over the world. everyone is suffering poverty. some places more than others. they deserve a shot to have a brighter future as well. don’t stop helping kenya but go around helping the other places who need the same help as kenya does. this help should be world-wide! so that we could all live in a better

nessecities to the people in poverty. but i think that they need to raise the targets because they need to get to so many people over 80 villages in sauri. the author convinced me because she knows that it’s going to take time and effort to win the fight against povert is achievable. 	something that the author wrote was that they have targets that they need to meet in 2015 and 2025. she says that the world is capable of meeting these targets but there is plenty of work to be done. the author mentions school for the children in poverty and it says that there parents have to pay fees, there barely have any supplies and they get no meal so at the end of the day the children are worn out. 	since they started to fight against poverty, children can go to school without paying any fees, they have enough supplies for the children and they get a midday meal. so they have achieved a lot they are able to go to school with out no problem of money, supplies, and food. another thing that that the author adresses in the text that convinces me is that she says that sauri has made great progress in just 4 years before people that needed to get help with there health needed to wait or not get any treatment because they had no money to pay the fee.	but now they have the total opposite of what they had before. because people was with fighting against poverty so many people have what they need. but they still have to do alot more work and they need to work very hard. they have goals to meet even though it might take sometime they will be able to meet their targets. and poverty will decrease the closer they they get to all of their targets. that’s why i agree with the author that they will win the right against poverty.",21131_020035735.docx,"the article that hanna sachs wrote called ”a brighter future” is about a 17 year old girl and her dad going to sauri, kenya which is in africa and seeing how people live there and how there is a lot of poverty. also she helps out the millennium villages project to get people out of poverty and stabilize their economy. i think we can win the fight against poverty. keep reading my essay and i would give you reasons why i think that.	one reason why i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable is that, first of all they are many people working on it. so if we all work together, then anything is possible. one example of what i am talking about is in the article, hanna sachs points out that in just four years, the people in sauri have made amazing progress just by working together and finding a solution. 	another reason why i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable is that we shouldn’t give up. what i mean by that is we shouldn’t give up even if we keep failing, sooner or later we will get it right. one example of that is in the article, the millennium villages project wants their goals to be met by 2015. their goals are to get people out of poverty, help to stabilize their economy and quality of life in their communities. i am sure if their goals are not met by 2015, they wouldn’t give up on it until they achieve it. 	some people might argue that by helping one country get out of poverty, we are putting another country into poverty. i disagree on that because if we all chip in something then no country will be in poverty. but one problem that we have is that. i don’t think many people have heard about sauri, kenya so i think if people are more informed about what is going on, they will be more than gladly to help fight against poverty.	like i said before, i think we can win the fight against poverty. if we all work together and never give up, then anything possible. and if we all chip in just a little that will become a lot and it will help the people in sauri, kenya. i am aware that kenya is not the only country that is poor. but i think we should take this fight step by step. i also think the millennium villages project’s goals could be met by 2015. these are my reasons why i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable. thank you for reading and i am sure this is possible.",21341_020030973.docx,"yes. i agree with the author that winning the

problem.	another example is that even in their tough situation, kids still want to learn. but without midday meals, they wouldn’t have the energy at the end of the day. learning is an important part

not enough supplies then they can share. even if they don’t want to share they can at least learn. the kids need to go to school or they can’t learn anything. the kids need to learn how to read and write. so they can have a little education. yea, but they don’t need to waste money and let the parents teach them. what of the parents don’t know how to read and write other then what do they do. it is very important that farmers can grow their crops. its important because they have to feed their families. if they can’t grow crops then they will lose money too. then get the fertilizers while they still have money. yea, but if they can’t grow crops then they can’t make money.it is very important that this goal is achievable because there is lot of people that need help out there. some people that are dieing have a family so if they die then their family would be in trouble. also if no one helps stop poverty then maybe that whole village can get wiped out. so it is very important that poverty can be stopped. there is only about 200-250 people in the village. so that number can be easily wiped out by poverty. even if one person doesn’t help then a person might die. so pretty much what we are asking is to help stop poverty so we can achieve our goal. if we wore the ones that needed help and no one helped us think about how we would fee. one way to improve this situation is to

education.	when hannah sache says that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime; i think she means that if all of us work together as in our commuity and people around us,

sub-district hospital stocked with medicine & free of charge. also, there are bed nets for sleeping sites & having the hunger crisis solved by giving crops fertilizer and seeds. i think this text is

said they are making a treatment for malaria because that a disease. and in the hospital beds there is 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed then you could imagin that it’s a lot of people in the

have the disease and later on in the year or upcoming years the doctors will learn more about curing people and the people in sauri might get more money to buy or get a bed net for people with the malaria disease",1121601Y3_000501122.docx,"yes, the author convinced me that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.” the author convinced me because in paragraph 9-10 in the story that was so much change in just 4 ears that i believe that we can end all of poverty in a whole lifetime. at the hospital they were able to make medicine free of charge, connect water to the hospital and add a generator, and use bed nets in every single sleeping site in sauri. that change there was major because it saved many lives in sauri and cured people free of charge. another major change in sauri was that there was no longer any school fees and they started to serve lunch for the kids. this change enabled more kids to be able to get a good education and be able to create a better life for themselves rather then staying at home and fetching water and wood. this also provided a meal for kids who might now even know where their next meal will come from and it prevents starvation for some of the kids in sauri. lastly, this is why i think we can with the fight against poverty in ourlifetime.	another reason why i think that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime” is because we are already making progress, so why stop now. the changes made in the four years basically saved a whole village and can probably save many more villages, cities, countries, continents and towns around the world. the bed nets can help to save many people from diseases and even ruming to the hospital in the first place. it can also save the new generation of kids to come and help some people to live longer in the village of sauri. the change of adding water and electricity can help the clinical officer to better help the patiends and better manage the hospital. also, this hospital’s changes started with helping one village that was in deep poverty to making a better life for 80 villages along the sub-saharan area. with these changes, i believe that the world will ban together and help to end poverty because in paragraph 10, it says that people have already started joinging the cause because their progress there, in that area has encouraged them to support the fight against poverty. lastly, i think we can win the fight against poverty because all around the world there are cures, medicines and healthful drugs that can prevent many diseases which can contribute to poverty in some places around the world.		the last reason why i think that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime” is because the world is filled with so many wonders and hunger, disease, or poverty doesn’t have to be one of them. another reason is that the day thing stopping us from ending poverty is just the people’s participation and cooperation because we already have the medicines, supplies, and tools, but you can not change anything without people to reshape an area and make it stable because once you provide a structure for good things to happen then the people will have room to start a better life for the many, many generations to come. then, everybody will have equal opportunities and abilities to create a better life for themselves and their families this is why i believe that “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime”.",41021_089981032.docx,"i agree because the author

how farming was bad because of the lack of water and fertilizer.  that lead to less food for the family.  also she tells us that kids couldn’t afford school.  for the people that could afford school, there were little supplies and no lunch.  that lead to tired kids in the end of the day.  now she tells us that seeds and fertilizer is given to the needs and that more people attend school now

a good point about us trying to fight poverty. like for example acsess to health care is good because if you end up getting sick it you won't have a doctor but if only we could send like a couple of 24 doctors to africa can help them. people need help so they can keep make a beeter life for the little kids. more education could be important for the kids in africa to be getting the right care. malaria can spread from person to person the only way you can't get it is if you get a bed that protects you at night from the diseas. people can't afford the beds because it is $5 and they useally only ern $1 a day. so if we could all just put are heads together then we can all get the supplies we need to help africa and everyone who lives there to get all they need to servive and have a good future. africa had no clean water so to make sure they get some we can start to send some from the u.s.a all the way to where they are and they can get all the water and electity they need. so the people can have air conditionor in the summer.  schooling for the kids is realy important because the kids need the egducation they can get so they can be what they want to be and set goals in life. medican will be needed so if someone get sick and the decid to be a doctor they could be able to help them out. so if we all just put are heads together and help one another we can acomplish are tasck to be able to help them.,2112601Y3_000508859.docx,"yes, the author convinced me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" i think the author convinced me that because in the article, it said that sauri, kenya is very poor and can only afford so many things. so, i think that even though sauri is improving, they still need our support. also, children can now go to school for free because not alot of people could afford it. i think that going to school for free is a good idea because kids need the education and they get to have lunch at school too so they arn't out of energy at the end of the day. another example i think the author convinced me this is because people who lived in sauri that had to go hospitals, had to share a room with at least 1 or 2 people. the hospitals also didn't have water, electricity, or a docotor. now, sauri has electricity and water at the hospitals. last, sauri had mosquitos that bit people and could've kid them or have gotten them very sick. nobody could afford bed nets. now, they have out bed nets for free so people could live. that's why it convinced me.",31042_020080557.docx,"now, there are so many poor people in different countries. they don’t have money and supplies for their live they have to starve and they don’t have clothes. they will sick or having diseases. now, we have to stop and do something for

them some food so they don’t need to starve. we also can help them to grow some crops. the kids need food, so they will not get sick. because of the fertilizer, the crops can’t growth. we have to buy some fertilizer fit for the plants.i think the hospital is free for the people are necessary when the people get sick or having diseases, the hospital should save their life first. the proverty people don’t have money to pay for the fee. hospital should add more doctors, nurse and medicines. the medicines are not enough for the patients. the hospital should make more rooms for the patients. every one should have their own beds.i think we should give them supplies to school. the kids don’t have money to buy their backpacks, pencils, pens or ruler. we should give them our supplies and we don’t need. the kids will want to go to school. there should not have school fees because many families can’t pay for their kids. school should have free lunch for them. i think helping people is fun and meaningful.",21232_020024049.docx,"winning the fight against poverty is achievable in several ways. first, it's important that people donate or try to raise money for providing supplies. secondly it is also important that we can provide these supplies by actually buying or creating them. lastly, we have to be able to ship it to africa so it starts to effect people's lives as soon as possible. here are more reasons in why these things are important to the people of sauri and the rest of africa.	united nations needs money to provide these supplies and reasources for africa. as it said in the text, ""the people of sauri have made amazing progress in just four years. the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all the most common diseases. water is connected to the hospital, which is also has a generator for electricty. bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri."" these are all happening because people are providing the united nations money for all these supplies and materials these people of sauri and africa need.	united nations also needs to make and buy all the supplies, which is another big part of how to achieve no poverty. ""their crops were dying because they could not afford necessary fertilizer and irragation. time and again, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of the lack of fertilizer and water."" these all happened before because no one was providing these people the materials that they needed. people were dying and getting sick because of these things. if they had what they needed people would ber a lot more healthy and it would save people's lives. this is a big factor that leads to my next point.	shipping these supplies is the only way that this cause can effect people's lives in africa. this is the most important because, if people can provide it but not be able to ship, there is no reason why people should be supporting this cause by sending money and making fundraisers. ""dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. the progress is encouraging to supporters of the millennium villages."" without the shipping provided this couldn't even be possible. that is the big thing that shipping does.	to sum it all up, money, supplies, and shipping are the three main and big things that are needed for poverty to stop. without these people would get sick and cause many deaths from diseases. people don't have good irrigations systems or farming tools which kills crops. this is how to win the battle to stop poverty in many places.",3123501Y3_000508267.docx,"yes i think the author convincee beause he told that. they don't have enough meony to buy food colthes and soff. they do not eat every day.they only get 30 dollars

progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in out lifetime."". i for one agree with this.	first of all, we have all the mechanics and technology to help. in sauri, there are unpaved dirt roads, people walking bare-footed, and people with tattered clothes. we and many others could help. we could pave the roads, make shoes, and make more clothing. all of these things are somewhat inexpensive and can be done quickly and easily.	secondly, we could have volunteers spend a coupld of months down there and cook food for the people of sauri. the article states the people are living on less that a $1 a day. the people of sauri need multiple things and a $1 won't get you those things. so the least we could do is help them out with their food problems.	another problem is sauri is malaira. malaria is a disease commonly found in mosquitos. it can easily be prevented and treated with medicines and bed nets. since this is so easily dealt, with, i think we should help those with the disease. all we could do is send syringes and bed nets to sauri.	also, there is the problem with hospitals. this is very hard to believe but there are 3 children to a bed. and i'm not done yet, there is no running water, no electricity, and no doctor! that's just sad if you can't have a docter in a hospital. we could donate more beds, plumbing, generators, and doctors in an instant.	lastly, there is the problem with schools. most of the schools do not have to appropiate materials to start the day with. but all of the students still want to learn. again, we could just just donate school supplies to these wanting-to-learn children. it would really help them out	in my honest opinion, i believe we can achieve this goal. in 2008, most of sauri's problems were solved. if we can solve it in sauri, then we could actually end all poverty. then everyone would have all their needs and could live like a human being.",41252_020009249.docx,"no, it can’t be achieve because there are a lot of people in the world.  there are a lot of adults and children that never had medical help because they or their family couldn’t afford it.  any sickness that they got they had to wait and stay at home until it was gone.  in the article it said the villagers weren’t in good shape.  if they could afford the hospital they probably won’t have room because there were 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed.  the kids and the adults don’t know each other anyway.  some paients that were at the hospital couldn’t get the right treatment because they couldn’t afford the treatment they needed.  even in the hospital there were no doctors, only clinical officer so i don’t think an officer can do anything that likely heal then people who had the diseases would die very fast.",21042_020063744.docx,"on this question i already have my own answer. if you want to know what i am thinking just look it.	i think the author did not convince me to “winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.” because on “a brighter future” the author tell us he is going to hlep the people out of poverty. second on the fight for better health”, one sentense say “the hosipitol did not have doctor only have a clinical officer running to the hosipitol”. this sentenses mean that country is very poverty, it did not have doctor or nurse. on “water, fertilizer, knowledge,” the farmers worry they did not have water to grow the crops. they also worry they did not have enough food for the kids. there are many kids did not attend school because their parents could not afford school fees. 	sum it ups, we really need to get the people out of poverty because there are many kids die in one years.on 2008 the people of sauri have amazing progress in 4 years. the hosipital have midicine and water is connected with hosipital. the farmers did not worry their kids for no foods.",21351_020021332.docx,"is winning the fight against poverty achievable in our lifetime? the millenium village project is working to reach the millenium development goals in kenya. while some say that the fight against poverty can be won in our lifetime, others disagree. we need to know if the millenium development goals can be achieved within a certain amount of time. i think that we can’t get rid of poverty, but, we can make a big difference. 	we can’t get rid of all poverty because they took 4 yrs to achieve the progress in sauri, and that was just one village billions of people live in poverty, and the village was only about 200-500 people. there millions of other villages that size. to solve the problem, we can just do multiple villages at a time, right? no, because it would take a lot of people and resources, but we don’t have all that.	secondly, it is impossible for there to be no poverty, because if everyone is living out of poverty, some people would still live better than them and that would become the new poverty. but others argue that if everyone has good living conditions, then there will be no poverty. to that, i would say, poverty is completely relative, so there always will be poverty.	some people may say that much was accomplished in sauri, kenya and that we can do this for other villages. i disagree with this point of view because it took a lot of time, for one, and it cost a lot of money. it also requires a lot of people to help out.	to summarize, we can’t get rid of all poverty, but we can make a big difference because it is impossible for there to be no poverty. we should keep working towards the millenium development goals and inform people about it through media. also, we could try to get people to donate or volunteer to help.",2121502Y3_000510454.docx,"yes the

the students. the attendance rate is way up.”, i think it still happens at our school, because the school provides lunch and my parents tell me that you don’t have to pay school fees when you’re in public school. “their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizar and irrigation” they could not afford the right fertilizar because they could not find much money to support their family. “bed nets could save millions of lives” they also could not afford bed nets because of poverty or because it was too much. bed net keep mosquitoes from kids and adults, that was good.",2151601Y3_000520617.docx,"the purpose of this paper is to give a example of the quality of life in sauri, kenya, then improved why the life was unfair in sauri, kenya. sauri kenya is in the untied nation's in africa. they treated unfairly because the didn't have the stuff we have now. also because the resources they haved before got taken away from country's that were more powerful. i will prove that the life their was unfair and find 4 examples that explain why the saying of the author convinced me.	sauri is a very poor country in africa. for example: the hospital had to put 2 or 3 children per each bed. two or three adult's had to go on each bed as well. maybe it's because the people couldn't afford better treatment's or the hospital couldn't afford more beds. that's just unfair, those people are poverty. which means poor people having little or no money.	the sauri people so poor, i'll repeat there were so poor they couldn't afford any type of techology. they couldn't afford oven's, microwave, they probably would afford to buy clothes. they also couldn't afford houses, they built houses out of wood or stick's. they had to use the old way, that people very long time ago used, nature.	they probably asked for the u.s.a for help. there was one problem, the u.s.a only helps with political problem. meaning if you want us to help you, what are you giving us in return. like when israeli asked u.s.a for help they denied their response. sauri didn't have anything to give them, so the u.s.a didn't help them.	sauri is a poor country. their were poverty. meaing little

do is to help out.  not many people are rich but if we help, everyday kids won’t die of hunger and malaria.we can also lower the price in things the people need and give out free bed nets to people instead of having malaria and adults getting sick all the time.i also think that we should give more supplies for school and having no school fees.  without food not much people will have enough strength.  so thats why we should give them food and fertilizer for them to grow their food.i agree with hannah that we should all work together and change poverty-stricken areas for good.if theres very less hospitals we should build more hospitals and more doctors also the medicine for malaria-including electricity.  i’m thinking,” how are they going to get electricity?”  some people don’t even

help them, is by letting them get funds in order. the reason they need to do that is to be able to get medicine for the village. this wil lhelp alot because the medicine can heal people and lower the death rate. sauri, kenya is a village in frica. this village is not good on economy.  a example is that the most of the children did not go to school. the reason why is because their parents could

lucky to be living the life i’m living now.	the other topic that convinced me is when she talked about their schools. some kids can’t even go to school because their parents can’t even afford it. if kids even attended school, they wouldn’t even have a lunch. so at the end of the day, they are very tired. they should have free school and lunch provided at their school. 	and the last topic that convinced me was when she talked about bed nets. if you can’t afford bed nets, you could have a chance that a mosquito could bite you, and yo can get malaria. it should be free for kids because kids could die easily from malaria. also, it should be cheaper for adults as well because the could get really sick from it too. 	this really convinced overall. just reading this made me really

than before. for example in the hospitals there was no running water of electicity, but now there is both. also before people couldn't afford to be treated so they died from diseases, but know they have medicine, free of cost, for most common diseases. so with this progress in medical help i think some poverty can be solved.	the millennium villages project supplied water and fertilizer to sauri, kenya. due to this kenya was able to produce more food than before. without fertilizer and water the farmers had trouble planting seeds. everytime the farmer tried to plant seeds they would dry out and die. this caused farmers to become famished. i the farmers had money to buy fertilizer and water they wouldn't starve from hunger. since more farms are now supplied with the tools and materials they need by 2015 and defiently by 2025 will most parts of poverty be solved.	children in kenya couldn't attend school simply because the parents couldn't afford it living off of 1 dollar

against poverty you would need people to help you out as a team.	some ways it is possible to fight poverty is making donations to people who need it. also there could be fund raiser to help the communty. people could give clothes, school supplies, money, or food to help people which are poor. that would help schools, and the homes for people.	farmers in sauri had poor crops and fertilizer. but if people gave them fertilizer and a water system they could be able to farm healthy crops. also farmers could feed their children or maybe earn money by selling the extra crops. if farmers can grow good crops then people near by can have food then have energy for their own job.	people in sauri who can’t afford a bed net or medicines have dead kids. but if everyone could just donate a few dollars they could be able to afford it. then lesser people would die and the population would grow higher. it would also let the community earn more money from the government.	so i think it is

i think it is possible because if it only takes about 4 years to balance out sauri with other countries in the world, then ending poverty in kenya is achievable. another reason kenya will reach up to other world standards is because the millennium villages prodject is probably going to make a commercial or a youtube video, and it is going to touch a lot of people out there because people in

beds for the mosquitos. in the article the say in sauri they have mosquitos that may carry malaria and the there is a cheap medicine that can treat it.my finall example is that the changes have

sauri, kenya needs help. this project they are working on it called the “millenium village.” their plan is to get everyone out of poverty. in sauri, people live on less than a dollar a day, they also do not have a stable, working hospital or school. their goal is supposed to be reached in 2015 and other goals are to be reached by 2025. if kids and adults got sick from malaria, they could not go to the hospital. they could buy a bed net, which was only $5. again they could not afford it. the people of the project revicied this data in 2004. in 2008 the project was still forthcoming, but they improved the schools and hospitals. even though there is much more to do. therefore i believe that the fight against poverty is not only achievable, but has already begun.",4122691Y2_100222979.docx,"yes because if we work hard and win the fight against poverty we can have a better lifetime. if we min against poverty we can also many kids can go to school and at

to save all the villages in africa. some of the governments might even go corrupt. 	it probally is possible because even though africa is big with many villages the people in the u.s are always ready to donate money for other people. sponsors for hospitals could also sponsor for medicine. 	but if the whole world got together and racked up money to save everyone under poverty, it might even work!
